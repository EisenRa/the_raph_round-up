    "text": "Hey everyone, bit more of a photo heavy round-up this month, hope you enjoy!\n\nBreaking news: sun seen in Copenhagen\nThat’s right, sources report that the sun has been sighted in Copenhagen after weeks of seemingly vanishing. We took advantage of this uncommon phenomenon by exploring a bit more of Christianshavn in central Copenhagen. Christianshavn (or Christian’s harbour) is a cute neighbourhood with canals and houseboats, and was supposedly established in the 17th century as a fortification to the city. The most striking landmark is the Church of Our Saviour – distinct on the Copenhagen skyline with its spiralling tip. The spiral is not just for aesthetics, one can climb all the way to the top, where one is greeted with fantastic views of Copenhagen. It was a beautiful day for taking some shots of Copenhagen!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCoffee and a chocolate scone (not common to find these in Copenhagen!)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSomeone made a nice green wreath\n© 2024.

After a relaxing train ride from Copenhagen, we made it to the Big Pretzel. It was my first time in Berlin, and I’ve always been interesting it the city from a historical perspective. It blows my mind that the Berlin Wall – the barrier between West Berlin (Western) and East Berlin (communist) only came down in 1989! Evidence of these two separate cities is still evidence in the architecture, with the Soviet-style still being visible in former East-Berlin.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPart of the original wall still standing, which now has heaps of cool art along it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStreet art\n© 2024.

This work is openly licensed via CC BY-NC 4.0\n\n\n\n\n\nI also visited the Stasi museum – housed in headquarters of the Stasi (secret police), with many rooms untouched since the fall of East Germany. It covered the history of post WW2 Germany well and had many interesting historical items. The extent of the public’s involvement in the Stasi as ‘unofficial collaborators’ is staggering (&gt;500,000). Surveillance has definitely changed since the rise of the internet, with the U.S. government’s surveillance of its own citizens being something quite mind-blowing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample of Soviet-style architecture\n© 2024.

The bunker (the Reichsbahnbunker) is unusual in that it’s above ground (Berlin is apparently on swampy terrain). After the war, it was going to be too much effort to demolish, so the bunker was used for other purposes, including the storage of fruit. After the wall fell in 1989, it turned into an underground techno club for a few years before the police blocked it off. Finally, in the early 2000’s some rich people bought it to host their private art collection. Apparently, given that the building doesn’t meet modern safety standard, a loophole was found such that if the owners built a penthouse on top of the bunker, they could offer guided tours of the artwork in their ‘basement’. We had a fantastic and knowledgeable guide (an artist himself) who walked us through this amazing structure, giving background on the history of both the building and artworks (along with interpretations). Overall, a strong recommendation for the next time you head to Berlin.\nFinally, it’s interesting to ponder some more on the use of the bunker. The Nazis apparently built the bunker also as a monument to the Third Reich – hoping it would last well into the future. By using it, are we acknowledging their intentions? Or by using the space for something else, are we protesting it?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe bunker (source: wikipedia)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can’t take photos in the collection, but the guide let us take a photo of the staircase.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNorthwest Zealand (northern hemisphere)\nFor the Easter weekend, we hired a summer house (doesn’t come with summer weather, unfortunately), in Northwest Zealand (Sjælland), about an hour’s drive from Copenhagen. This was the second time that I’ve been in a car since moving to Denmark – which goes to show how easy life is with a bike in Copenhagen! Overall, a relaxing weekend, and I was glad to get away from everything and have time to read and catch up with family.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLammefjord in the morning with fog\n© 2024.

This work is openly licensed via CC BY-NC 4.0\n\n\n\n\nInteresting things I’ve read/watched\nCheck out this interesting video about the world’s northern-most brewery. Even if you’re not interested in beer, the history and landscape is fascinating. For those who like craft beer, I can thoroughly recommend their other videos (I also support them on Patreon).\nGas, the new coal? Rollie Williams and team put out another fantastic video, this time on gas. I love Climate Town’s content – well-researched and engaging. If you’re looking for rigorous climate-related journalism, check their channel out.\n[New Zealand Geographic] is my favourite long-form journalism output. Here’s a great article about how environmental DNA (eDNA) is being used for biodiversity monitoring, habitat quality assessments, and invasive species detection in NZ. You can check out the WilderLab website to even explore how healthy streams are near you!\nLastly, a very nice article about why society journals will be part of the solution for issues in the scientific publishing industry. I detest how the parasite that is the for-profit publishing industry is harming science. I’ll be writing a post about this soon to provide context for people not in academia, so stay tuned.\n\n\n\nCoffee and a chocolate scone (not common to find these in Copenhagen!)\nSomeone made a nice green wreath\n© 2024.

    "text": "Welcome to another monthly round-up! You may have noticed that we have a new URL – I ended up buying a domain name and email server, so there’s now an option to sign up to a mailing list if you want updates when new round-ups are published (see bottom of page).\nThis month is more photo heavy than last, so I hope you enjoy some Swedish winter shots. There’s also an article about the hallowed Danish rye bread O.o\n\nWinter holiday in Sweden\nMatilda had the great idea of going for a winter holiday, and I’d also been very eager to explore more of Scandinavia while living in Copenhagen. So we packed our bags and escaped the grey clouds of Copenhagen and took a ~6-hour train to Sweden’s capital, Stockholm. Stockholm (circa 1 million people) definitely has a bigger city feel compared to Copenhagen (circa 600,000). IMO Copenhagen feels a bit cosier, and easier to get around with amazing cycling infrastructure. Still we had a really nice time walking around, thrift-shopping, and tasting baked Swedish delicacies. We also visited a cool photography museum (Fotografiska) that was quite inspiring!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChilly in Stockholm!\n© 2024.

This work is openly licensed via CC BY-NC 4.0\n\n\n\n\n\nThe next leg of the journey took us circa 600 kilometres north, to a latitude of ~64°N! Adelaide by comparison is ~35°S (Wellington ~41°S) – so much closer to a pole than we’ve ever been before. We took a sleeper cabin in a night train (see photo), which was a really fun experience, before arriving at our destination at around 9 AM. Granö is a small rural town of roughy 200 inhabitants, and home to Granö Beckasin, a cosy hotel and destination. Here we stayed in a hyggelig cabin, went for hikes in the snow, cross-country skied, and did mushing (dog sledding)! They also had a sauna and hole in the ice for winter bathing. We did plan to go for a northern lights tour, but alas it was cloudy on the night (good excuse to go back up north again!). Overall it was a really nice stay, and Granö Beckasin definitely seems to be accomplishing what they set out to do – making Granö a holiday destination and in doing so keeping the town alive.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur destination: Granö.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCozy train sleeper cabin!

This work is openly licensed via CC BY-NC 4.0\n\n\n\n\n\nA definite highlight for me was the mushing (dog sledding). We got to drive a two-person sled, with one person sitting and the other driving. The dogs take care of most of it (they follow the guide’s sled), but you have two brakes that you need to apply on downhills or when you want to stop. On the uphills, you also hop off and run to help push the sled up. The guides were super nice, and we learned a lot about what it takes to look after and manage mushing dogs. They know each of the ~40 dogs by name, experience, and personality. They have to account for which dogs get along with each other and their relative experience when picking the sled team. The lead (front) dogs also receive special training such that they can make turns on verbal command. It was a fantastic experience, and really made me appreciate how special these animals are.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDog sledding! #1\n© 2024.

We took a nice walk along the waterfront (ice-front??), and came across a really cool sculpture made by Jaume Plensa. I only took one photo, but it’s designed to look similar from different angles, see here for examples. We then went to a really nice contemporary art museum, Bildmuseet, which as it turns out was designed by the acclaimed Danish Henning Larsen Architects.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJULIA 2017\n© 2024.

This work is openly licensed via CC BY-NC 4.0\n\n\n\n\n\nThe home leg of our journey took us on a six-hour train from Umeå to Stockholm, followed by another night train to Copenhagen, where we arrived around 8 AM. Overall, it’s one of the best holidays I’ve had – it was magical being so far north and seeing so much snow! Train travel is also so much more relaxing than flying, and night trains (if you have a bed) are a really comfortable and efficient way to travel.\n\n\nRugbrød (rye bread)\nLet’s go back to Denmark, and cover a topic that’s particularly Danish, namely rugbrød (rye bread). Most Danes consume rugbrød every day – typically for lunch – and I reckon it’s the secret to their height and overall health :-) It’s high in fibre and extremely nutritious. Danes and rye (Secale cereale) go back at least 1,000 years, and my understanding is that it was more cold-tolerant than wheat, hence its popularity up here. A classic Danish food is smørrebrød (translates to butter bread), an open-faced rugbrød sandwich. This can be as simple as rugbrød with whatever toppings/leftovers you happen to have in the fridge, or a fancy version offered by one of the many smørrebrød establishments in the city (see photos).\nIn Feb I tried making rugbrød for the first time – mostly to practice for when I head back to Aus/NZ one day (it’s really hard to find there). My undertanding is that all rugbrød is made with sourdough due to the special characteristics of rye flour. Rye has a much lower quantity of gluten than wheat, relying instead on pentosans (polymers of 5-carbon sugar) for texture. Rye also typically has a much higher (and more active) amylase content (enzyme that splits amylose into simple sugars). This is where the sourdough comes in, as the acidity lowers the amylase activity – preventing all the amylose from being chewed up, which would result in a gummy texture. I honestly found it much easier than my usual wheat sourdough loaf, though maybe I got lucky with the fermentation timing!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMy first rugbrød bake!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFancy Danish Smørrebrød #1 (https://copenhagenfood.dk/aamanns-etablissement/).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFancy Danish Smørrebrød #2 (https://migogkbh.dk/aamanns-aabner-nyt-sted/).\n\n\n\n\n\nSådan laver du rugbrød (this is how you make rye bread). Once again, I followed a recipe from the excellent Simpel Sourdough. Seeds and cracked rye kernels are soaked overnight to soften, then the next morning this mixture is added to rye flour, sourdough starter, water, salt, and optionally malt syrup/molasses. Let the microbes do their magic (they were super active with this mixture!), then bake. Really nice as toast in the morning with butter and Vegemite/Cenovis or honey. It’s definitely a loaf I’ll now be making regularly, and a nice recipe to bring back to Aus/NZ one day.\n\n\nSpring is slowly making itself known\nThe days are getting longer (finally!) Presently, the days are 4 hours and 22 minutes longer than at the winter solstice, which makes a huge difference! Sunrise is at roughly 6:40, and sunset is at roughly 18:00, so we’re over the worst of the darkness. We’ve even got some brave plants that are bringing some colour to the landscape (despite the fact that it’s 2 degrees C as I’m writing this!):\n\n\n\nPioneering snowdrop! One of the first flowers to start blooming in the Danish spring.\n© 2024. This work is openly licensed via CC BY-NC 4.0\n\n\n\n\nPhoto of the month\n\n\n\nLonely bicycle in Umeå. Sums up how much snow we saw in Sweden! 35mm, ISO 100, f / 3.2, 1/1600 sec\n© 2024.

This month we have To Øl Natur’s Omnipresent. Really nice balance of sweetness from local honey, funkiness from the wild microbes, and fruitiness from local cherries. To Øl is a great Danish craft brewery located on Zealand (easternmost island of Denmark, where Copenhagen is also found). They have a project, To Øl Natur, which is all about barrel-aged mixed-fermentation saisons and wild ales. Wild here refers to not inoculating your brew with a specific strain of microbe (e.g. Saccharomyces cerevisiae AKA brewer’s yeast), but opening the door to other microbes. This usually results in super interesting flavours – but I’ll cover this in a future post :)\n\n\nInteresting things I’ve read/watched\nStory about why blue LEDs were so hard to make – and why cracking this was so important for more efficient lighting + most screens that we now use. Veritasium is an amazing science communicator, and I recommend checking out his other stuff if you haven’t already.\nRichard Dennis’ speech to the National Press Club. Richard (from the Australia Institute) is a national treasure, and I love how he calls out bullshit in simple terms.\n\nIn Norway they tax the fossil fuel industry and they give university education to their kids for free. In Australia we subsidise the fossil fuel industry and we charge our kids a fortune to go to uni. The Australian government collects more money from HECS [student loan system] than it does from the petroleum resource rent tax.\n\nI can highly recommend his book, Econobabble.\nWhy facts don’t change minds: Insights from cognitive science for the improved communication of conservation research. Really eye-opening paper about how people process information for decision making. The focus is on conservation information, but the underlying ideas apply universally IMO.\nAccording to Yanis Varoufakis, capitalism has been killed by technofeudalism – which is much worse. The thesis is that we are now serfs to big tech overlords (Amazon, Google, Apple, Meta), and that the traditional capitalist market is no more. I’ll definitely be adding his book on this to my reading list.\n\n\n\nChilly in Stockholm!\n© 2024.

    "text": "Spring has sprung! It’s a relief to finally see more colours in Copenhagen – I hope you enjoy this update :-)\n\nA Spring to your step\nForåret er kommet (spring has come) to Copenhagen. Growing up in New Zealand and Australia, spring never seemed like a particularly special time of the year to me. Perhaps it’s the fact that most of the native trees are evergreen, and that we see flowering throughout much of the year (as well as winter not being so harsh). Since moving to Copenhagen, however, I’ve been blown away with how remarkable spring is here. Flowers of all shapes, shades, and sizes spring out from slumber – as do the Danes, who emerge from their hyggelige (cosy) apartments and flock to the local parks to soak in the rays. Not to mention it’s now light when you wake up in the morning AND when you get home from work in the evening! I guess there’s a few factors at play here – the winter being so much darker and colder here, coupled with the trees being bare and seemingly lifeless. Scent may also play another important role; just the other day I was walking through the local park and realised that I can smell plants now! Regardless, spring is something I’ve come to really relish since moving to Denmark.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHad a nice day out at Kastellet (the citadel), a fortress built in the 1600s. Now a popular place for a walk on a beautiful spring day.\n© 2024. This work is openly licensed via CC BY-NC 4.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBridge across to the fortress.\n© 2024.

You’ve probably heard of Carlsberg. Founded in 1847, it has become an internationally known beer. Did you know that scientists at the Carlsberg Research Laboratory invented the pH scale? The founder, J.C. Jacobsen, believed that science was the key to unlocking consistent and high-quality beer. The Carlsberg Foundation (the not-for-profit organisation that controls the majority voting rights for Carlsberg A/S) continues to invest into science and society today.\nIn 2008, Carlsberg moved their beer production to Jutland (in Denmark), and in its place, the Carlsberg City District is being developed. (I’ll cover this in a future article, as it’s quite interesting, and a great example of how high-density living can be done well.) Overall, I’d say it’s well worth a visit if you’re in Copenhagen. I think they did a great job with the exhibition – it’s engaging, interesting, and well put together. That the exhibition runs through the old brewery gives it a great historical feel, and I think they nailed the design of modern meets historical.\nWhile I always support local independent breweries, if I had to drink a ‘macro’ beer, it’d be Carlsberg. That it’s governed by a not-for-profit foundation that actually invests back into Denmark (and science in general) is clear. I’ll also admit that it tastes pretty damn good, and it’s clear to me that they continue to be driven by a desire to produce quality beer.\nAn honourable mention to Til’s highlight of the visit – the small fleet of Carlsberg horses and ponies, the former of which still draw the traditional Carlsberg beer wagon around the neighbourhood a few times a week. The rest of the time, they all seem to have a pretty relaxing life acting as Carlsberg brand ambassadors.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe four magic ingredients ‘photo from Matilda’\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn OG steeping tank – love the lighting\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can walk through and admire Carlsberg’s collection of &gt;20,000 beer bottles! Also from the comfort of your own pyjamas\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow damn cool is this?!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCarlsberg once used horses for transporting their beer around the city. I think it’s great that they have kept the stables going as a nod to the important work these horses did. ‘photo from Matilda’\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYour ticket of course includes a beer at the end. ‘photo from Matilda’\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMatilda, Elizabeth and Gary outside the old brewery.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLunch of the month?\nJust a nice excuse to promote Auren’s Deli in Frederiksberg – thanks Tiff for the suggestion!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLaekkert! ‘photo from Matilda’\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto of the month\nNothing says spring like these trees at the Copenhagen Sakura Festival near Kastellet.\n\n\n\n35mm, ISO 100, f / 1.8, 1/1600 sec\n© 2024.

An excellent article that touches on the question of ‘when is a scientific fact a scientific fact?’. It features quotes from David Taggart, a colleague and good friend from Adelaide who’s also the leading Southern Hairy-nosed Wombat expert – shout out to Tags! From my own personal experience catching wombats for many years for research, they can run bloody fast! I plan to write a blog post about wombats in the coming months, so stay tuned :-)\nAn area the size of 5 USAs is what humans use for agriculture today. 77% of this area is used for meat/dairy production, and this not just for grazing (half of the world cropland is fed to animals for meat/dairy). Our World in Data provide us with another engaging article on this topic.\nBanks in Australia are making a killing with surcharges, surprise surprise.\nI also watched an Australian senate hearing about the issues with Australia’s supermarket duopoly. Lower competition = higher prices, who’d have thunk it? Greg and Matt from the Australian Institute do a great job highlighting these issues in plain English.\nFinally, I highly recommend this talk and discussion from Yanis Varoufakis. A very compelling look at the consolidation in big tech, and what this will mean for our futures.\n\n\n\nHad a nice day out at Kastellet (the citadel), a fortress built in the 1600s.

    "text": "Huh?\nA resolution I made this year is to write a short summary of each month, for posterity, and for sharing with friends and family. You may be thinking, huh, why? Well, I have a few reasons:\n\nI’m pretty terrible at keeping in touch with people overseas, and given that I now live in Denmark, this could be a nice way of letting you know what’s going on; and\nI think it will be a nice exercise of self-reflection – something that I don’t do enough of.\nIt’s also a great opportunity for me to learn some quarto/css, which is what I’ll be using to create/format these posts.\n\nIf you’re curious as to how I made this blog for free, check out the quarto guide\nSo if you’re reading this, velkommen to the first instalment! I’ll try to keep these succinct and full of photos (you may even learn something about Danish culture). In addition, I’ll have a ‘photo-of-the-month’ section at the end (taken with my camera).\n\n\n2024 starts with a bang\nActually, it’s more like bangs for a whole week leading up to NYE. For some reason, Danes light a lot of fireworks. According to DR (the national broadcaster), 500 million DKK (111 million AUD) is spent annually on personal fireworks. That’s a lot for a country of 5.8 million, and doesn’t include the estimated 1.7 tonnes of illegally imported fireworks. Growing up as a kid in NZ, I remember getting a small pack to light for one night (Guy Fawkes). However, here, fireworks are legal to purchase from the 15th of December, but only to fire from the 28th of December – 1st of January. The reality is that people are lighting them weeks leading up to NYE (due to a lack of enforcement) – and they are way louder than what we had in NZ (it’s basically military-grade ordinance). Even with the excellent building insulation in Denmark (we have triple-glazing), you can still hear bozos lighting them at 11 PM on a weeknight…\n\n\n\n\n\nFireworks from our apartment’s roof. Note: you can click images to enlarge them!\n\n\nIt looks like public opinion is changing, with &gt;50% of surveyed Danes supporting a ban on personal firework usage (ref). In addition, the government is looking to restrict personal usage to between the 31st of December and 1st of January for 2024-2025. Though I’m not confident that this will be enforced. Perhaps I should have brought my 600 mm telescopic lens with me to Denmark to catch people in the act? If you’re interested in some anecdotes from the locals, check out this reddit thread.\n\n\nSnow in Copenhagen\nWe don’t get a lot of snow in Copenhagen, but some snow is more than I ever got living in Australia and NZ, and so I’m always excited when we get some! I’m keen put together a post analysing and visualizing historical snowfall trends in Copenhagen, so keep your eyes out.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSøndermarken\n© 2024. This work is openly licensed via CC BY-NC 4.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDecent snowfall (for Copenhagen)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTaken by Matilda\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReturn of the Fastelavnsboller\nWhat the heck is a Fastelavnbolle (and how do you even pronounce it)? For this piece, I’m bringing in my historical and cultural correspondent (Dr Matilda Handsley-Davis) for some background on this tasty topic:\n\nFastelavn is a Danish festival with Christian roots. It’s part of the same tradition as Carnival or Mardi Gras – a chance to indulge in some excess just before the start of Lent. Unsurprisingly, fatty and sugary treats play a large role in this indulgence – hence, the Fastelavnsbolle (Fastelavn bun). A ‘gammeldags’ (‘olden days’) version is a sweet, yeasted bun filled with marzipan and/or whipped cream, topped with chocolate icing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGammeldags bolle - purchased from Københavns bageri\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGammeldags bolle - cross section\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, Danish bakeries nowadays (maybe especially in Copenhagen?) are engaged in an annual arms race to create the most popular, delicious, or outrageous combinations of pastries, fillings, and flavours. Croissant dough, berries, citrus curd, and mascarpone are some popular avant-garde ingredients. Some bakeries also dabble in the Swedish version, ‘semla’ – a soft, cardamom-spiced bun with roasted almonds and a lot of whipped cream. While the diversity is exciting, having now tasted about six or seven different varieties across this and last year, I would actually say that a good-quality gammeldags number is hard to beat.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAvant-garde bolle - purchased from Københavns bageri (our local)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAvant-garde bolle - flot snit!! (nice cross section)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe actual day of Fastelavn is seven weeks before Easter Sunday, so it always falls in February or early March – but the boller seem to hit the shelves as soon as everyone has recovered from New Year’s Eve. It’s surely not a coincidence that the season for this ultimate comfort food falls in a gloomy and dark time of year when everyone’s a bit sick of winter.\n\n\nInterestingly, Fastelavn also bears quite a few similarities to Halloween. Kids traditionally dress up in costumes and go from house to house singing and asking for Fastelavnsboller. If they don’t get them, they may ‘make trouble’ – so kind of the Danish version of trick-or-treating. Children may also gather to ‘hit the cat out of the barrel’ with sticks – now a kind of pinata filled with lollies and maybe a paper cat. Back in the day, the tradition was quite a bit darker – an actual cat, symbolising the Devil, would be put into an actual barrel and set upon by people bearing sticks. This was supposed to symbolise driving evil away.\n\n\nTo finish up, here is an approximate phonetic pronunciation guide for ‘Fastelavnsbolle’: fess-tuh-lowns-boh-luh (the ‘ow’ as in ‘how’ or ‘clown’)\n\nStory by Matilda – she may be making more contributions in the future.\n\n\nLooks like pizza is back on the menu boys!**\n I love pizza, but making a good pie at home is tough without a speciality pizza oven. A key element is the high heat required to cook said pizzas quickly – allowing for the base to be properly cooked, and for a nice spring in the crust. Years ago I previously tried a pizza stone but found it still wasn’t getting hot enough or cooking the pizzas quickly – ending my hopes of making good pies at home. Flash forward to 2023, when I came across a video by simpel dourdough demonstrating the use of a steel for making pizza. I decided to give it a shot, and the first attempt came out really nice!**That’s a Lord of the Rings reference if you didn’t catch it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe prodigal pie – first bake with new setup\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe steel setup. Top shelf of oven with grill turned on for max heat ouput\n\n\n\n\n\nI guess steel is far more conductive than stone, so the heat transfer to the pizza is much higher. The first two pizzas were cooked back-to-back, and took only 3.5 minutes each! I’m using a sourdough (66% hydration), cold fermenting in the fridge for 1-7 days. It’s actually a super convenient weeknight meal. I make the dough on the weekend, and on the night just need to fire up the oven, shape, top, and bake! If you want to learn more about the pros/cons of stones vs. steels, check out this article by seriouseats.\n\n\nPhoto of the month\n\n\n\nFrederiksberg Palace with snow.

This work is openly licensed via CC BY-NC 4.0\n\n\n\n\nInteresting things I’ve read/watched\nOur world in datahas some brilliant visualizations of data on a range of topics. Here’s one on the environmental impacts of various foods, and why plant-based milks are better for the environment than dairy milk. IMO you should give plant-based drinks a try again – they’ve really improved (oat is my favourite).\nWhy Swiss trains are the best in the world: Really nice video showing how great the Swiss train network is. The received wisdom is that Swiss trains are the best in the world, but this videos actually runs you through why this is the case. If you like it, check out his other videos – he makes great content relating to civic planning/transportation. I particularly liked the quote attributed to a former mayor of Bogotá Colombia:\n\nAn advanced city is not one where even the poor use cars, but rather one where even the rich use public transport.\n\n\n\n\nFireworks from our apartment’s roof.
