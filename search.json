Here are some hardy plants on our rooftop – at the peak of Spring and Summer the plot is swarming with bees. I’m guessing this is a feature to help support bees.

The older looking white building to the right is the old mineral water factory built circa 1920 (Mineralvandsfabrikken). Apparently, Carlsberg founder J.C. Jacobsen was the first to bottle/sell soda water in Scandinavia. Interestingly, soda water in Denmark is called Danskvand (Danish water). It’s thought this naming was used to distinguish it from Swedish soda water, which was often coloured red (source).\n© 2024.

It’s a great way for city slickers to get out into the country and realise that vegetables actually grow in the ground. We were all split up into smaller groups, each tasked with a certain dish to design and cook for the group dinner. It was a lot of fun, and the veges and herbs grown there were amazing (especially the cherry tomatoes!). To get to Godis Grønt, we took a pleasant ~12 km walk through some Danish countryside (including a nice forest).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nForest shrooms\n© 2024.

Nice to be reunited with my 150-600mm BAZOOKA wildlife lens :smile:\n© 2024. This work is openly licensed via CC BY-NC 4.0\n\n\n\n\nPhoto of the month\nOn the hike to Godis Grønt we passed a beautiful forest (Bidstrup Skovene) and lake (Avnsø). Part of the reason for buying a new tripod was to get more into landscape photography, so this was the first landscape shot with the new setup. What you see is a 10 second exposure, only possible due to the use of a ND (neutral density) filter. These filters go in front of the lens, and the idea is to block light from hitting the camera sensor in an even fashion (i.e. no colour bias). This allows one to open the camera shutter for a longer period of time and capture a scene with the added element of time.\nThere are many creative reasons as to why one would wish to do so. For this shot, I wanted to smooth out the water to simplify the shot, as moving water can be quite busy and distracting. I also wanted to portray the movement of the wind on the branches and leaves of the tree, as I think it adds a nice contrast to the otherwise sharp foreground. The last little detail I love of the shot is the opening in the branches just left of centre of the shot, where one can look out over the lake to the other side. (I didn’t actually intend this in the composition, but it’s a happy accident).\n11mm, f / 8.0, 10 sec, ISO 100, ND1000 filter\n\n\n\n© 2024. This work is openly licensed via CC BY-NC 4.0\n\n\n\n\nInteresting things I’ve read/watched\nAmbient field recording in remote Australia. Natural soundscapes are beautiful, and I’m glad that people are out there recording them.\n\nTax Justice Network released a working paper showing what could be done if the top 0.5% wealthiest were taxed at a minor rate of 1.7-3.5% (press release).\n\nWe estimate that a tax between 1.7 percent and 3.5 percent on the top 0.5 percent wealthiest would result in revenues of an average of 7.3 per cent of current tax revenues of federal or central governments, adding up to more than US$2.2 trillion\n\nSpain apparently already does this, so it’s not exactly reinventing the wheel. Something definitely needs to be done, considering that:\n\nOn average, just 3% of each country’s wealth is owned by half its population, while its richest 0.5% own a quarter"

Given the power and reach of the tech giant this will be a tough job.\nWhy self-driving cars are probably not a good idea for future urban planning. Long video, but well-researched and worth the watch.\nA positive story about how Utrecht went from car-dominated to perhaps the best cycling city in the world. To me it’s clear how living in a cycle-friendly city has massive benefits for people’s health and well being. Though I’m reminded of this quote by one 15th century Italian philosopher/cynic:\n\n“It must be considered that there is nothing more difficult to carry out … than to initiate a new order of things; for the reformer has enemies in all those who profit by the old order, and only lukewarm defenders in all those who would profit by the new order; this lukewarmness arising partly from the incredulity of mankind who does not truly believe in anything new until they actually have experience of it.”\n\n—Niccolò Machiavelli"

    "text": "Hey everyone, bit more of a photo heavy round-up this month, hope you enjoy!\n\nBreaking news: sun seen in Copenhagen\nThat’s right, sources report that the sun has been sighted in Copenhagen after weeks of seemingly vanishing. We took advantage of this uncommon phenomenon by exploring a bit more of Christianshavn in central Copenhagen. Christianshavn (or Christian’s harbour) is a cute neighbourhood with canals and houseboats, and was supposedly established in the 17th century as a fortification to the city. The most striking landmark is the Church of Our Saviour – distinct on the Copenhagen skyline with its spiralling tip. The spiral is not just for aesthetics, one can climb all the way to the top, where one is greeted with fantastic views of Copenhagen. It was a beautiful day for taking some shots of Copenhagen!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCoffee and a chocolate scone (not common to find these in Copenhagen!)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSomeone made a nice green wreath\n© 2024.

After a relaxing train ride from Copenhagen, we made it to the Big Pretzel. It was my first time in Berlin, and I’ve always been interesting it the city from a historical perspective. It blows my mind that the Berlin Wall – the barrier between West Berlin (Western) and East Berlin (communist) only came down in 1989! Evidence of these two separate cities is still evidence in the architecture, with the Soviet-style still being visible in former East-Berlin.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPart of the original wall still standing, which now has heaps of cool art along it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStreet art\n© 2024.

This work is openly licensed via CC BY-NC 4.0\n\n\n\n\n\nI also visited the Stasi museum – housed in headquarters of the Stasi (secret police), with many rooms untouched since the fall of East Germany. It covered the history of post WW2 Germany well and had many interesting historical items. The extent of the public’s involvement in the Stasi as ‘unofficial collaborators’ is staggering (&gt;500,000). Surveillance has definitely changed since the rise of the internet, with the U.S. government’s surveillance of its own citizens being something quite mind-blowing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample of Soviet-style architecture\n© 2024.

The bunker (the Reichsbahnbunker) is unusual in that it’s above ground (Berlin is apparently on swampy terrain). After the war, it was going to be too much effort to demolish, so the bunker was used for other purposes, including the storage of fruit. After the wall fell in 1989, it turned into an underground techno club for a few years before the police blocked it off. Finally, in the early 2000’s some rich people bought it to host their private art collection. Apparently, given that the building doesn’t meet modern safety standard, a loophole was found such that if the owners built a penthouse on top of the bunker, they could offer guided tours of the artwork in their ‘basement’. We had a fantastic and knowledgeable guide (an artist himself) who walked us through this amazing structure, giving background on the history of both the building and artworks (along with interpretations). Overall, a strong recommendation for the next time you head to Berlin.\nFinally, it’s interesting to ponder some more on the use of the bunker. The Nazis apparently built the bunker also as a monument to the Third Reich – hoping it would last well into the future. By using it, are we acknowledging their intentions? Or by using the space for something else, are we protesting it?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe bunker (source: wikipedia)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can’t take photos in the collection, but the guide let us take a photo of the staircase.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNorthwest Zealand (northern hemisphere)\nFor the Easter weekend, we hired a summer house (doesn’t come with summer weather, unfortunately), in Northwest Zealand (Sjælland), about an hour’s drive from Copenhagen. This was the second time that I’ve been in a car since moving to Denmark – which goes to show how easy life is with a bike in Copenhagen! Overall, a relaxing weekend, and I was glad to get away from everything and have time to read and catch up with family.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLammefjord in the morning with fog\n© 2024.

Rollie Williams and team put out another fantastic video, this time on gas. I love Climate Town’s content – well-researched and engaging. If you’re looking for rigorous climate-related journalism, check their channel out.\n[New Zealand Geographic] is my favourite long-form journalism output. Here’s a great article about how environmental DNA (eDNA) is being used for biodiversity monitoring, habitat quality assessments, and invasive species detection in NZ. You can check out the WilderLab website to even explore how healthy streams are near you!\nLastly, a very nice article about why society journals will be part of the solution for issues in the scientific publishing industry. I detest how the parasite that is the for-profit publishing industry is harming science. I’ll be writing a post about this soon to provide context for people not in academia, so stay tuned."

Many Danes flock to other countries to absorb some much-needed sun and work on their tans. I personally feel that summer in Denmark is close to perfect – temperatures of low to mid-twenties – and I can’t comprehend why some travel to Spain in summer to melt in 30-40+ temps. This year, we spent a couple of weeks in Utrecht, the Netherlands, to meet up with some family visiting from New Zealand. Growing up, holidays in my family always involved hopping on what is perhaps one of the greatest inventions in human history – the bicycle. What better place to continue this tradition than the Netherlands, a country widely recognised as a nation of cyclists? Here are some photos from our time there (see the captions on each photo for details).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe cycle network in the Netherlands seems very well set up!

We took the Nightjet (overnight train) from Amsterdam to Basel, followed by a beautiful train ride from Basel to Nyon in western Switzerland, close to Geneva. You can’t go to Switzerland without enjoying some hiking, so here are some photos from a day hike to La Dôle peak (1,677 metres) in the Juras. The weather was absolutely fantastic – 25+ in Nyon, but cooler in the higher altitudes of the Juras.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMorning. The view of our destination (La Dôle) from Nyon.

Also touches on why they are not the best from an environmental point of view (e.g. water use). More natural approaches can be better for wildlife (e.g. offering shelter, pollination options.).\nYes Australia’s environment is on a depressing path, but 7 billion a year would transform it. A summary article about a report costing approaches for restoring/improving Australia’s environment. Aus as a nation is definitely wealthy enough to afford this – for comparison, fossil fuel producers were subsidised ~14 billion from 2023-2024!. If only we could get our priorities right..\n\nThe internet isn’t more important than the climate emergency, nor gender justice, racial justice, genocide, or inequality. But the internet is the terrain we’ll fight those fights on. Without a free, fair and open internet, the fight is lost before it’s joined.\n\n-Corey Doctorov"

    "text": "Welcome to another monthly round-up! You may have noticed that we have a new URL – I ended up buying a domain name and email server, so there’s now an option to sign up to a mailing list if you want updates when new round-ups are published (see bottom of page).\nThis month is more photo heavy than last, so I hope you enjoy some Swedish winter shots. There’s also an article about the hallowed Danish rye bread O.o\n\nWinter holiday in Sweden\nMatilda had the great idea of going for a winter holiday, and I’d also been very eager to explore more of Scandinavia while living in Copenhagen. So we packed our bags and escaped the grey clouds of Copenhagen and took a ~6-hour train to Sweden’s capital, Stockholm. Stockholm (circa 1 million people) definitely has a bigger city feel compared to Copenhagen (circa 600,000). IMO Copenhagen feels a bit cosier, and easier to get around with amazing cycling infrastructure. Still we had a really nice time walking around, thrift-shopping, and tasting baked Swedish delicacies. We also visited a cool photography museum (Fotografiska) that was quite inspiring!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChilly in Stockholm!\n© 2024.

This work is openly licensed via CC BY-NC 4.0\n\n\n\n\n\nThe next leg of the journey took us circa 600 kilometres north, to a latitude of ~64°N! Adelaide by comparison is ~35°S (Wellington ~41°S) – so much closer to a pole than we’ve ever been before. We took a sleeper cabin in a night train (see photo), which was a really fun experience, before arriving at our destination at around 9 AM. Granö is a small rural town of roughy 200 inhabitants, and home to Granö Beckasin, a cosy hotel and destination. Here we stayed in a hyggelig cabin, went for hikes in the snow, cross-country skied, and did mushing (dog sledding)! They also had a sauna and hole in the ice for winter bathing. We did plan to go for a northern lights tour, but alas it was cloudy on the night (good excuse to go back up north again!). Overall it was a really nice stay, and Granö Beckasin definitely seems to be accomplishing what they set out to do – making Granö a holiday destination and in doing so keeping the town alive.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur destination: Granö.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCozy train sleeper cabin!

This work is openly licensed via CC BY-NC 4.0\n\n\n\n\n\nA definite highlight for me was the mushing (dog sledding). We got to drive a two-person sled, with one person sitting and the other driving. The dogs take care of most of it (they follow the guide’s sled), but you have two brakes that you need to apply on downhills or when you want to stop. On the uphills, you also hop off and run to help push the sled up. The guides were super nice, and we learned a lot about what it takes to look after and manage mushing dogs. They know each of the ~40 dogs by name, experience, and personality. They have to account for which dogs get along with each other and their relative experience when picking the sled team. The lead (front) dogs also receive special training such that they can make turns on verbal command. It was a fantastic experience, and really made me appreciate how special these animals are.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDog sledding! #1\n© 2024.

We took a nice walk along the waterfront (ice-front??), and came across a really cool sculpture made by Jaume Plensa. I only took one photo, but it’s designed to look similar from different angles, see here for examples. We then went to a really nice contemporary art museum, Bildmuseet, which as it turns out was designed by the acclaimed Danish Henning Larsen Architects.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJULIA 2017\n© 2024.

This work is openly licensed via CC BY-NC 4.0\n\n\n\n\n\nThe home leg of our journey took us on a six-hour train from Umeå to Stockholm, followed by another night train to Copenhagen, where we arrived around 8 AM. Overall, it’s one of the best holidays I’ve had – it was magical being so far north and seeing so much snow! Train travel is also so much more relaxing than flying, and night trains (if you have a bed) are a really comfortable and efficient way to travel.\n\n\nRugbrød (rye bread)\nLet’s go back to Denmark, and cover a topic that’s particularly Danish, namely rugbrød (rye bread). Most Danes consume rugbrød every day – typically for lunch – and I reckon it’s the secret to their height and overall health :-) It’s high in fibre and extremely nutritious. Danes and rye (Secale cereale) go back at least 1,000 years, and my understanding is that it was more cold-tolerant than wheat, hence its popularity up here. A classic Danish food is smørrebrød (translates to butter bread), an open-faced rugbrød sandwich. This can be as simple as rugbrød with whatever toppings/leftovers you happen to have in the fridge, or a fancy version offered by one of the many smørrebrød establishments in the city (see photos).\nIn Feb I tried making rugbrød for the first time – mostly to practice for when I head back to Aus/NZ one day (it’s really hard to find there). My undertanding is that all rugbrød is made with sourdough due to the special characteristics of rye flour. Rye has a much lower quantity of gluten than wheat, relying instead on pentosans (polymers of 5-carbon sugar) for texture. Rye also typically has a much higher (and more active) amylase content (enzyme that splits amylose into simple sugars). This is where the sourdough comes in, as the acidity lowers the amylase activity – preventing all the amylose from being chewed up, which would result in a gummy texture. I honestly found it much easier than my usual wheat sourdough loaf, though maybe I got lucky with the fermentation timing!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMy first rugbrød bake!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFancy Danish Smørrebrød #1 (https://copenhagenfood.dk/aamanns-etablissement/).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFancy Danish Smørrebrød #2 (https://migogkbh.dk/aamanns-aabner-nyt-sted/).\n\n\n\n\n\nSådan laver du rugbrød (this is how you make rye bread). Once again, I followed a recipe from the excellent Simpel Sourdough. Seeds and cracked rye kernels are soaked overnight to soften, then the next morning this mixture is added to rye flour, sourdough starter, water, salt, and optionally malt syrup/molasses. Let the microbes do their magic (they were super active with this mixture!), then bake. Really nice as toast in the morning with butter and Vegemite/Cenovis or honey. It’s definitely a loaf I’ll now be making regularly, and a nice recipe to bring back to Aus/NZ one day.\n\n\nSpring is slowly making itself known\nThe days are getting longer (finally!) Presently, the days are 4 hours and 22 minutes longer than at the winter solstice, which makes a huge difference! Sunrise is at roughly 6:40, and sunset is at roughly 18:00, so we’re over the worst of the darkness. We’ve even got some brave plants that are bringing some colour to the landscape (despite the fact that it’s 2 degrees C as I’m writing this!):\n\n\n\nPioneering snowdrop! One of the first flowers to start blooming in the Danish spring.\n© 2024. This work is openly licensed via CC BY-NC 4.0\n\n\n\n\nPhoto of the month\n\n\n\nLonely bicycle in Umeå. Sums up how much snow we saw in Sweden! 35mm, ISO 100, f / 3.2, 1/1600 sec\n© 2024. This work is openly licensed via CC BY-NC 4.0\n\n\n\n\nBeer of the month\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo Øl Natur’s Omnipresent\n\n\n\n\n\nThought I’d be cheeky and include a new ‘Beer of the month’ section! This month we have To Øl Natur’s Omnipresent. Really nice balance of sweetness from local honey, funkiness from the wild microbes, and fruitiness from local cherries. To Øl is a great Danish craft brewery located on Zealand (easternmost island of Denmark, where Copenhagen is also found). They have a project, To Øl Natur, which is all about barrel-aged mixed-fermentation saisons and wild ales. Wild here refers to not inoculating your brew with a specific strain of microbe (e.g. Saccharomyces cerevisiae AKA brewer’s yeast), but opening the door to other microbes. This usually results in super interesting flavours – but I’ll cover this in a future post :)\n\n\nInteresting things I’ve read/watched\nStory about why blue LEDs were so hard to make – and why cracking this was so important for more efficient lighting + most screens that we now use. Veritasium is an amazing science communicator, and I recommend checking out his other stuff if you haven’t already.\nRichard Dennis’ speech to the National Press Club. Richard (from the Australia Institute) is a national treasure, and I love how he calls out bullshit in simple terms.\n\nIn Norway they tax the fossil fuel industry and they give university education to their kids for free. In Australia we subsidise the fossil fuel industry and we charge our kids a fortune to go to uni. The Australian government collects more money from HECS [student loan system] than it does from the petroleum resource rent tax.\n\nI can highly recommend his book, Econobabble.\nWhy facts don’t change minds: Insights from cognitive science for the improved communication of conservation research. Really eye-opening paper about how people process information for decision making. The focus is on conservation information, but the underlying ideas apply universally IMO.\nAccording to Yanis Varoufakis, capitalism has been killed by technofeudalism – which is much worse. The thesis is that we are now serfs to big tech overlords (Amazon, Google, Apple, Meta), and that the traditional capitalist market is no more. I’ll definitely be adding his book on this to my reading list."

We decided to cycle there to check out an exhibition, Descension by Anish Kapoor. I really loved it – sculptures that played with light and sound in interesting ways, often deceiving the senses.\nI was a bit shocked to find out that Anish made an exclusive deal with Surrey Nanosystems, a company that manufactures “vantablack” – a super dark pigment that absorbs ~99.96% of light.

I was delighted when she gave the affirmative, and so the planning began for a three-section (two-night) journey in southern Sjælland, plus the islands of Falster and Møn. Our first bikepacking trip would be more on the ‘glamping’ end of things, opting for overnight stays at bed & breakfasts over camping, as first impressions are important! The plan: ~180 km over three days (70, 70, 40).\n\n\n\nThe route, Gedser-Helsingor, national route #9 source: https://ruter.dk/route/gedser-helsingoer\n\n\nDay 1 saw us take a 9 AM train trip from Copenhagen central station to Nykøbing-Falster (about 1:20 hours south of the capital). Armed with snacks and a positive attitude (despite the shower that was not forecast by meteorologists … ), we put rubber to road for the first leg of our journey.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEarly morning train ride from Copenhagen central to Nykøbing-Falster (~1:30 hours).

This work is openly licensed via CC BY-NC 4.0\n\n\n\n\n\nAs you can see from the photos, this first leg saw us cross over to three different islands: Falster -&gt; Bogø -&gt; Møn. While this may sound impressive, we’ve got a long way to go should we wish to set foot on all of Denmark’s ~1,400 islands (~409 of which are named). About 90% of the track was sealed (mostly quiet country roads), with the rest being lovely gravel tracks through forests on the west coast of Falster. With 70 km done and dusted, we arrived at Stege, the main town of the isle of Møn. A well-earned beer and dinner enjoyed, we hit the hay at a bed and breakfast.\n\n\nMy first Danish bikepacking trip (day 2)\nI awoke to a beautiful sunrise, heralding favourable weather for the next 70-km leg that would take us back onto the island of Sjælland to Rødvig. Breakfast consumed, we were on our way out of Stege, and over the sizable Dronning Alexandrines bridge that connects Møn to Sjælland. Rolling Danish countryside greeted us as we made our way to the town of Præstø. It turns out that there was a vintage bicycle festival happening in the town on the day (perhaps a good omen?). We stopped for some lunch at a local (and delicious) bakery (Præstø Bagværk). Here we devoured a classic surdejsbolle med ost (sourdough bun with cheese) and slice of kage (cake). This fueled us for the next leg on to the coastal town of Rødvig.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSunrise reflecting on the wall.\n© 2024.

Arriving at Rødvig, we went down to ocean to relax and refresh the feet.\n\n\nMy first Danish bikepacking trip (day 3)\nThe final, homewards section of the trip saw us cycling near the white chalk cliffs of Stevns Klint, a geological destination and UNESCO World Heritage site. The shift from rural to increasingly urbanised was evident in the last 20 km of journey as we made our way towards Køge. At Køge, we caught the train back to Copenhagen, as we had previously done this 40-km section (spoiler: it’s boring).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHøjerup Gamle Kirke (Højerup old church, circa 1250) sitting right on the cliffs.

I personally had a blast, and will definitely be checking out some more of the national bike routes in the future. While Matilda may just stick to day rides in the future, I’m super proud of her for taking a risk and trying something like this.\nIn last month’s round-up, I alluded to a comparison between cycling in the Netherlands vs. Denmark. While I’m not adequately qualified to weigh in much here (having only sampled a little bit in either country), I’ll say that the Netherlands had far more bike-only paths (even in the middle of nowhere!) compared to Denmark, which relied a lot on quiet roads. I personally don’t mind sharing the road with cars, especially as these were low-speed roads, and Danish drivers are very courteous and cognisant of cyclists.\n\n\nPhoto of the month\nView down onto the beach at Stevns klint.\n\n\n\n© 2024.

Produced by a couple of law professors, I thoroughly enjoyed this superbly researched and illustrated journey. Amazing to think that forms of music such as jazz and soul wouldn’t be around if present day music copyright was around at the time. Here’s a trailer, and it’s free to download and read here. Here’s also a 30 minute lecture by the authors if you’re interested.\nA fantastic article by Michael Bunce about GMOs (genetically modified organisms) in NZ.\nGreat vid about issues relating to water use in the USA."

    "text": "Spring has sprung! It’s a relief to finally see more colours in Copenhagen – I hope you enjoy this update :-)\n\nA Spring to your step\nForåret er kommet (spring has come) to Copenhagen. Growing up in New Zealand and Australia, spring never seemed like a particularly special time of the year to me. Perhaps it’s the fact that most of the native trees are evergreen, and that we see flowering throughout much of the year (as well as winter not being so harsh). Since moving to Copenhagen, however, I’ve been blown away with how remarkable spring is here. Flowers of all shapes, shades, and sizes spring out from slumber – as do the Danes, who emerge from their hyggelige (cosy) apartments and flock to the local parks to soak in the rays. Not to mention it’s now light when you wake up in the morning AND when you get home from work in the evening! I guess there’s a few factors at play here – the winter being so much darker and colder here, coupled with the trees being bare and seemingly lifeless. Scent may also play another important role; just the other day I was walking through the local park and realised that I can smell plants now! Regardless, spring is something I’ve come to really relish since moving to Denmark.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHad a nice day out at Kastellet (the citadel), a fortress built in the 1600s.

You’ve probably heard of Carlsberg. Founded in 1847, it has become an internationally known beer. Did you know that scientists at the Carlsberg Research Laboratory invented the pH scale? The founder, J.C. Jacobsen, believed that science was the key to unlocking consistent and high-quality beer. The Carlsberg Foundation (the not-for-profit organisation that controls the majority voting rights for Carlsberg A/S) continues to invest into science and society today.\nIn 2008, Carlsberg moved their beer production to Jutland (in Denmark), and in its place, the Carlsberg City District is being developed. (I’ll cover this in a future article, as it’s quite interesting, and a great example of how high-density living can be done well.) Overall, I’d say it’s well worth a visit if you’re in Copenhagen. I think they did a great job with the exhibition – it’s engaging, interesting, and well put together. That the exhibition runs through the old brewery gives it a great historical feel, and I think they nailed the design of modern meets historical.\nWhile I always support local independent breweries, if I had to drink a ‘macro’ beer, it’d be Carlsberg. That it’s governed by a not-for-profit foundation that actually invests back into Denmark (and science in general) is clear. I’ll also admit that it tastes pretty damn good, and it’s clear to me that they continue to be driven by a desire to produce quality beer.\nAn honourable mention to Til’s highlight of the visit – the small fleet of Carlsberg horses and ponies, the former of which still draw the traditional Carlsberg beer wagon around the neighbourhood a few times a week. The rest of the time, they all seem to have a pretty relaxing life acting as Carlsberg brand ambassadors.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe four magic ingredients ‘photo from Matilda’\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn OG steeping tank – love the lighting\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can walk through and admire Carlsberg’s collection of &gt;20,000 beer bottles! Also from the comfort of your own pyjamas\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow damn cool is this?!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCarlsberg once used horses for transporting their beer around the city. I think it’s great that they have kept the stables going as a nod to the important work these horses did. ‘photo from Matilda’\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYour ticket of course includes a beer at the end. ‘photo from Matilda’\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMatilda, Elizabeth and Gary outside the old brewery.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLunch of the month?\nJust a nice excuse to promote Auren’s Deli in Frederiksberg – thanks Tiff for the suggestion!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLaekkert! ‘photo from Matilda’\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto of the month\nNothing says spring like these trees at the Copenhagen Sakura Festival near Kastellet.\n\n\n\n35mm, ISO 100, f / 1.8, 1/1600 sec\n© 2024.

An excellent article that touches on the question of ‘when is a scientific fact a scientific fact?’. It features quotes from David Taggart, a colleague and good friend from Adelaide who’s also the leading Southern Hairy-nosed Wombat expert – shout out to Tags! From my own personal experience catching wombats for many years for research, they can run bloody fast! I plan to write a blog post about wombats in the coming months, so stay tuned :-)\nAn area the size of 5 USAs is what humans use for agriculture today. 77% of this area is used for meat/dairy production, and this not just for grazing (half of the world cropland is fed to animals for meat/dairy). Our World in Data provide us with another engaging article on this topic.\nBanks in Australia are making a killing with surcharges, surprise surprise.\nI also watched an Australian senate hearing about the issues with Australia’s supermarket duopoly. Lower competition = higher prices, who’d have thunk it? Greg and Matt from the Australian Institute do a great job highlighting these issues in plain English.\nFinally, I highly recommend this talk and discussion from Yanis Varoufakis. A very compelling look at the consolidation in big tech, and what this will mean for our futures."

    "text": "And so, another year passes. I’m pretty glad that I managed to get a monthly round-up done for each month of 2024 (even if some were horrendously late). I think this is an exercise I will keep doing into 2025. I will, however, endeavour to make it less of a mad rush at the end of the month and try and chip away at it weekly.\nTo help enforce this habit, for 2025 I want to make an effort to spend more time out with the camera (at least a couple of hours a week). Being outside (even in Danish winter) and open to observing the world makes me happy. It doesn’t have to be anywhere fancy, there’s always something interesting to be found – even in places that we walk by and take for granted every day. There’s a difference between seeing and observing (like hearing and listening)and being out with the camera helps me observe the world around me.\nI hope you’ve enjoyed these round-ups, and wish you well for 2025!\n\n\n\n\nTaken from the balcony of the Danish Architechture Centre. Actually had a break in the clouds on the horizon for sunset (at ~3:40 PM).\n© 2024. This work is openly licensed via CC BY-NC 4.0\n\n\n\n\nFrom the archives\nIt’s been a pretty cozy December here, and I’ve not been out much with the camera. Instead, I thought I’d share a few photos from my catalogue. I’ve had my trusty D7200 since September 2016, and have learned a lot about photography since then, both about using the camera itself (harvesting light, depth, composition) and developing the RAW file outputs. Eight years is a long time, and who we are when we take a photo (or even develop it) influences the final product. Photos are literal snapshots in time, both of the scene we capture, and of ourselves. Are these photos perfect? Definitely not. Would I have taken the exact compositions as I did then, today? Possibly not. Regardless, in the moment it felt right to me to click the shutter, and here are the results (with my present day take on developing the photos).\nAdditionally, I recently moved away from Adobe (because they’re scumbags), and am now using DxO Photolab for my RAW file processing. A big benefit here is that one can actually buy a lifetime license (like the good old days), rather than paying monthly subscriptions to Adobe (who then funnel that money through tax-friendly havens to shareholders). As a result, my older photos are now blank canvases for me to develop again (with a new perspective).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOne of the oldest images I have with my camera + Tokina 100mm macro lens (circa October 2016)\n© 2024.

The structure you see is called a domatium (latin for house, same root as ‘domestic’ I guess). These are structures made by some plant species to house beneficial invertebrates. I’m not 100% what these invertebrates do for the host plants, perhaps fight off parasites? Regardless, they are pretty cool evolutionary features!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom Adelaide, I think a Currawong (pied??). I love the background in this shot. While it’s quite busy, the depth of field smooths it out nicely. I also like the shadow of the prominant beak on the bird’s foot.\n© 2024.

You know that corruption runs deep in an industry when the death of said CEO was met with widespread support by people online. Clearly, healthcare in the USA is failing its citizens, but why? Fantastic article by Matt Stoller, who delves into both historical and contemporary context to help explain why this assassination happened, and the public’s response to it. If you want to read more, Matt also put out another article dealing with why healthcare is in such an abyssal state in the USA. It’s quite a complex and convoluted system (by design), but the main answer is monopolization/consolidation. 7 of the top 20 US companies by revenue are healthcare providers, with UnitedHeathcare coming in at 4th(!!), just behind Walmart, Amazon, and Apple. Should we be monetising an industry so important to our societies? IMO, absolutely not.\nAnd here’s another great article by Cory Doctorow about healthcare in the USA.\n\nUHC leads the nation in claims denials, with a denial rate of 32% (!!). If you want to understand how the US can spend 20% of its GDP and get the worst health outcomes in the world, just connect the dots between those two facts: the largest health insurer in human history charges the government a 183,300% markup on covid tests and also denies a third of its claims.\n\nYep, that % is not a typo, they charged the government $11,000 for each $8 covid test."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Huh?\nA resolution I made this year is to write a short summary of each month, for posterity, and for sharing with friends and family. You may be thinking, huh, why? Well, I have a few reasons:\n\nI’m pretty terrible at keeping in touch with people overseas, and given that I now live in Denmark, this could be a nice way of letting you know what’s going on; and\nI think it will be a nice exercise of self-reflection – something that I don’t do enough of.\nIt’s also a great opportunity for me to learn some quarto/css, which is what I’ll be using to create/format these posts.\n\nIf you’re curious as to how I made this blog for free, check out the quarto guide\nSo if you’re reading this, velkommen to the first instalment! I’ll try to keep these succinct and full of photos (you may even learn something about Danish culture). In addition, I’ll have a ‘photo-of-the-month’ section at the end (taken with my camera).\n\n\n2024 starts with a bang\nActually, it’s more like bangs for a whole week leading up to NYE. For some reason, Danes light a lot of fireworks. According to DR (the national broadcaster), 500 million DKK (111 million AUD) is spent annually on personal fireworks. That’s a lot for a country of 5.8 million, and doesn’t include the estimated 1.7 tonnes of illegally imported fireworks. Growing up as a kid in NZ, I remember getting a small pack to light for one night (Guy Fawkes). However, here, fireworks are legal to purchase from the 15th of December, but only to fire from the 28th of December – 1st of January. The reality is that people are lighting them weeks leading up to NYE (due to a lack of enforcement) – and they are way louder than what we had in NZ (it’s basically military-grade ordinance). Even with the excellent building insulation in Denmark (we have triple-glazing), you can still hear bozos lighting them at 11 PM on a weeknight…\n\n\n\n\n\nFireworks from our apartment’s roof. Note: you can click images to enlarge them!\n\n\nIt looks like public opinion is changing, with &gt;50% of surveyed Danes supporting a ban on personal firework usage (ref). In addition, the government is looking to restrict personal usage to between the 31st of December and 1st of January for 2024-2025. Though I’m not confident that this will be enforced. Perhaps I should have brought my 600 mm telescopic lens with me to Denmark to catch people in the act? If you’re interested in some anecdotes from the locals, check out this reddit thread.\n\n\nSnow in Copenhagen\nWe don’t get a lot of snow in Copenhagen, but some snow is more than I ever got living in Australia and NZ, and so I’m always excited when we get some! I’m keen put together a post analysing and visualizing historical snowfall trends in Copenhagen, so keep your eyes out.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSøndermarken\n© 2024. This work is openly licensed via CC BY-NC 4.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDecent snowfall (for Copenhagen)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTaken by Matilda\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReturn of the Fastelavnsboller\nWhat the heck is a Fastelavnbolle (and how do you even pronounce it)? For this piece, I’m bringing in my historical and cultural correspondent (Dr Matilda Handsley-Davis) for some background on this tasty topic:\n\nFastelavn is a Danish festival with Christian roots. It’s part of the same tradition as Carnival or Mardi Gras – a chance to indulge in some excess just before the start of Lent. Unsurprisingly, fatty and sugary treats play a large role in this indulgence – hence, the Fastelavnsbolle (Fastelavn bun). A ‘gammeldags’ (‘olden days’) version is a sweet, yeasted bun filled with marzipan and/or whipped cream, topped with chocolate icing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGammeldags bolle - purchased from Københavns bageri\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGammeldags bolle - cross section\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, Danish bakeries nowadays (maybe especially in Copenhagen?) are engaged in an annual arms race to create the most popular, delicious, or outrageous combinations of pastries, fillings, and flavours. Croissant dough, berries, citrus curd, and mascarpone are some popular avant-garde ingredients. Some bakeries also dabble in the Swedish version, ‘semla’ – a soft, cardamom-spiced bun with roasted almonds and a lot of whipped cream. While the diversity is exciting, having now tasted about six or seven different varieties across this and last year, I would actually say that a good-quality gammeldags number is hard to beat.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAvant-garde bolle - purchased from Københavns bageri (our local)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAvant-garde bolle - flot snit!! (nice cross section)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe actual day of Fastelavn is seven weeks before Easter Sunday, so it always falls in February or early March – but the boller seem to hit the shelves as soon as everyone has recovered from New Year’s Eve. It’s surely not a coincidence that the season for this ultimate comfort food falls in a gloomy and dark time of year when everyone’s a bit sick of winter.\n\n\nInterestingly, Fastelavn also bears quite a few similarities to Halloween. Kids traditionally dress up in costumes and go from house to house singing and asking for Fastelavnsboller. If they don’t get them, they may ‘make trouble’ – so kind of the Danish version of trick-or-treating. Children may also gather to ‘hit the cat out of the barrel’ with sticks – now a kind of pinata filled with lollies and maybe a paper cat. Back in the day, the tradition was quite a bit darker – an actual cat, symbolising the Devil, would be put into an actual barrel and set upon by people bearing sticks. This was supposed to symbolise driving evil away.\n\n\nTo finish up, here is an approximate phonetic pronunciation guide for ‘Fastelavnsbolle’: fess-tuh-lowns-boh-luh (the ‘ow’ as in ‘how’ or ‘clown’)\n\nStory by Matilda – she may be making more contributions in the future.\n\n\nLooks like pizza is back on the menu boys!**\n I love pizza, but making a good pie at home is tough without a speciality pizza oven. A key element is the high heat required to cook said pizzas quickly – allowing for the base to be properly cooked, and for a nice spring in the crust. Years ago I previously tried a pizza stone but found it still wasn’t getting hot enough or cooking the pizzas quickly – ending my hopes of making good pies at home. Flash forward to 2023, when I came across a video by simpel dourdough demonstrating the use of a steel for making pizza. I decided to give it a shot, and the first attempt came out really nice!**That’s a Lord of the Rings reference if you didn’t catch it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe prodigal pie – first bake with new setup\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe steel setup. Top shelf of oven with grill turned on for max heat ouput\n\n\n\n\n\nI guess steel is far more conductive than stone, so the heat transfer to the pizza is much higher. The first two pizzas were cooked back-to-back, and took only 3.5 minutes each! I’m using a sourdough (66% hydration), cold fermenting in the fridge for 1-7 days. It’s actually a super convenient weeknight meal. I make the dough on the weekend, and on the night just need to fire up the oven, shape, top, and bake! If you want to learn more about the pros/cons of stones vs. steels, check out this article by seriouseats.\n\n\nPhoto of the month\n\n\n\nFrederiksberg Palace with snow.

This work is openly licensed via CC BY-NC 4.0\n\n\n\n\nInteresting things I’ve read/watched\nOur world in datahas some brilliant visualizations of data on a range of topics. Here’s one on the environmental impacts of various foods, and why plant-based milks are better for the environment than dairy milk. IMO you should give plant-based drinks a try again – they’ve really improved (oat is my favourite).\nWhy Swiss trains are the best in the world: Really nice video showing how great the Swiss train network is. The received wisdom is that Swiss trains are the best in the world, but this videos actually runs you through why this is the case. If you like it, check out his other videos – he makes great content relating to civic planning/transportation. I particularly liked the quote attributed to a former mayor of Bogotá Colombia:\n\nAn advanced city is not one where even the poor use cars, but rather one where even the rich use public transport."

    "text": "A hop, skip, and a bounce (retrospective)\nAsk someone living across the world what they think of when they hear ‘Australia’, and chances are they’ll say ‘kangaroo’. Australia is indeed home to an amazing biodiversity, with many animals found nowhere else on the planet. It’s no surprise then that Australia is known for its rich and ‘exotic’ animal life. Have you heard of a wallaby? If the answer is ‘yes’, you’d likely think that they are a small type of kangaroo – and you’d be right! The term ‘wallaby’ is an informal one used to refer to small or medium-sized members of the ‘Macropodidae’ – a family of Australian mammal that contains ‘Skippys’ of all sizes. From the strapping red kangaroo, clocking in at up to 85 kg (!), to the tiny mala (rufous hare-wallaby), weighing in at around 1 kg. Lesser known is the yellow-footed rock wallaby, the focus of this story.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRed kangaroo, the largest living macropodid. fir0002 flagstaffotos [CC BY-NC], via wikipedia.org\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRufous hare-wallaby (Mala). Michael Hains, some rights reserved [CC BY-NC], via iNaturalist.org\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInto the outback\nIt starts with an early morning; the sky is clear, and the day promises temperatures of low 20s – perfect for a long drive into the outback. A white 4WD ute (pickup truck) – with large trailer in tow – rolls down the driveway. The crew is here to pick me up: Chloe, Shannon, Lauren and Tags. ‘G’days’ are exchanged, my gear is loaded, and we’re on the road north. Our target: the spectacular Vulkathunha-Gammon Ranges National Park ~600 km north of Adelaide, home to the elusive and vulnerable yellow-footed rock wallaby (YFRW). Our mission: to check in on the local YFRW population, a part of Lauren’s PhD project.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe drive. Source: Google Maps (Dutch version …)\n\n\n\n\n\nAs with many of Australia’s native mammals, the YFRW is listed as vulnerable. The YFRW was considered a common feature of the arid landscape a century ago. However, a mixture of historical hunting for its beautiful fur, overgrazing of its habitat by feral introduced herbivores (e.g. goats), pressure from invasive predators (foxes), and human land use change have seen the YFRW’s population drop. Thankfully, the Bounceback program led by the National Parks and Wildlife Service SA and other partners has seen a steady recovery of the YFRW and its habitat. Established in 1992, this program has seen a 10-fold increase in the numbers (~2,000) and areas occupied by YFRWs in South Australia.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe yellow-footed rock wallaby.\n© 2024.

From here onwards, we’re met with stunning, rugged landscapes, and see some of the local wildlife that make a living up here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLandscape.\n© 2024.

It’s late afternoon: we’ve still got a few hours of daylight left, but it’s not time to relax just yet.\n\n\nThe traps are set\nAs their name suggest, rock wallabies live in rocky areas that afford them a degree of safety from predators. Looking around, I’m amazed at the habitat that they call home – rugged rocky outcrops and vertigo-inducing cliff faces.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe crew heading out to set the traps.\n© 2024.

This work is openly licensed via CC BY-NC 4.0\n\n\n\n\n\nHow does one catch a YFRW in this environment? Traps. The only problem: we need to lug them up to where they live. While we get to work, I get the feeling that we’re being watched. While hoisting the traps up these cliffs, we occasionally hear a few rocks tumbling in the distance – likely signs of the local YFRWs hopping about.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYFRW spotted on the hike up with the trap. The ease with which they traverse this rugged landscape is mind blowing.\n© 2024. This work is openly licensed via CC BY-NC 4.0\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter a couple of hours of grunting and sweating, the traps are set, and we bait them with a mixture of apples and peanut butter oat balls (a trusty recipe). Sniffing, I get a strong whiff of anise. Shannon sprays some rocks around the traps with a scent that supposedly piques the YFRWs’ natural curiosity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnother view with trap in frame.\n© 2024.

The morning is fresh, but there’s a promise of heat as the sun rises. After a quick brekky and tea, we’re back on the road towards the trapping site. While we climb to check in on the traps, we see the beautiful landscape brighten as the sun rises and hear the birds make their morning calls.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSunrise on the cliffs.\n© 2024.

Measurements are taken: weights, the lengths of body parts, and genetic and microbial samples (faeces and pouch swab)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJuvenile wallaby about to be measured.\n© 2024.

This work is openly licensed via CC BY-NC 4.0\n\n\n\n\n\nOccasionally, we’d come across an amazing sight – pouch young (joeys) developing in their mothers’ pouches. Wallabies, like most native Australian mammals, are marsupials (from Latin/Greek marsupium, meaning pouch). The pouch is a key defining trait for marsupials, which are typically born very young (after only a few weeks), and start life with an epic journey from the birth canal to the safety of the mothers pouch see video. Marsupials are our distant relatives, with estimates that we shared a common ancestor ~160 million years ago (when dinosaurs ruled the planet)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNewly born wallaby on a teat! Macropodids have multiple teats, and the young will move to the next one at a certain stage of development.\n© 2024. This work is openly licensed via CC BY-NC 4.0\n\n\n\n\n\nMeasurements made and samples taken, the wallabies are brought back to where they were caught and released – putting myself in their (big) shoes, I can only imagine it being similar to abduction by aliens!\n\n\nThe other locals\nWith a hard day’s work done, we went to check in on the other locals – this time, in a more familiar (and less vertically demanding) urban habitat. Arkaroola, a short 700 km north of Adelaide, is a wildlife sanctuary and cozy township. Established in 1968 by geologist Reg Sprigg, Arkaroola has become a base for intrepid travellers wishing to get a taste of the South Australian outback. This tiny town hosts a few motels and camp sites, a licenced restaurant and pub, and workshop/petrol station. With the sun setting, and enjoying a beer at the local watering hole, we bumped into Doug Sprigg – custodian, director of Arkaroola for the past 50 years, and son of the late Reg Sprigg. Doug is passionate about the local region, and a veritable font of knowledge. He’s also an avid astronomer – a great pastime up here, with Arkaroola recently becoming South Australia’s first international dark sky sanctuary. He happily gives us a tour of the local town – and distant galaxies, through an impressive telescope.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nArkaroola.\n© 2024.

Warm evenings spent outside enjoying the company, wine, and endless stars.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere’s plenty of life in arid Australia, you just have to be patient and observant.\n© 2024.

After a few hours lugging the traps back down from the rocky landscape and cleaning them, they’re loaded back on the trailer, and we make the long journey home to Adelaide. The long trip back gives me plenty of time to contemplate the week and absorb what has been a truly amazing experience. It’s certainly opened my eyes to the sheer beauty of Australia’s rugged arid landscape, and an appreciation for the animals and plants that make it their home.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheeky pitstop at the Quandong Cafe.\n© 2024.

Human-induced climate change is likely to alter their habitat, making an already tough habitat tougher. However, knowing that there are passionate people out there looking after the landscape and animals, and organisations running successful programs like Bounceback fills me with hope. I believe that it’s our collective responsibility to ensure that these remarkable landscapes and animals are preserved, and that they can be enjoyed by future generations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYFRW in its habitat.\n© 2024.

    "text": "I can’t believe we’re at the end of May already! The weather has been absolutely fantastic here in Copenhagen this month, and in this edition, we’re continuing with the spring theme. \n\nSvaner på søerne (swans on the lakes)\nOn my commute to the office, I’m lucky to cycle right alongside some lakes. Which lakes, you may ask? Well, ’The Lakes’ (søerne in Danish), of course. These lakes are just west of the inner city, and are a real iconic feature of Copenhagen. You’ll see many locals (and tourists) enjoying a walk or run around the ~6.4 km lakes.\nSwans – the national Danish bird – also enjoy the lake, and in spring, some will nest just alongside the water. Last year, some kind people (from the council, I presume), actually built a little fence around a swan nesting site that was right next to the walking path. I’m not sure if this was to protect the swans from dogs/people, or vice-versa! This year, I’ve been keeping an eye on one such swan family on my commute, waiting for the day for the swanlings to hatch.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMother incubating the eggs.\n© 2024.

This work is openly licensed via CC BY-NC 4.0\n\n\n\n\n\nThe day came late in May (the 22nd), so here I present to you some young (&lt;24 hour) swanlings (AKA cygnets – ed.)! It was definitely worth lugging my camera around with me each day in anticipation. All in all, another really nice expression of life coming back in the Danish spring.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n:O\n© 2024.

This work is openly licensed via CC BY-NC 4.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nButterflies and flowers are pretty much the same thing (change my mind)\nNow for other expressions of spring – albeit less natural, as this was a visit to the Copenhagen Botanic Garden with my 105 mm macro lens. Butterflies and flowers are more similar than you might think at first glance, despite one being an insect and the other being a plant. Biologically, they both exist primarily for one purpose – sex and reproduction. Both are typically ephemeral (don’t hang around for long), and both bring an amazing diversity of colours and shapes to our world. They are also both quintessentially spring! While a botanic garden is an artificial environment, they are great places to appreciate Earth’s amazing biodiversity, and I’m always blown away at how much plant diversity there is in the world. Botanic gardens are also great places for taking close up (macro) photos (which I love). Them was the words, here be the photos, enjoy:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFlowers.\n© 2024.

We decided to take advantage of a recent long weekend by taking our first trip to Jutland, specifically to a small town called Viborg. Why Viborg of all places? Well, there’s a great bakery there that I found out about (they put out some nice video recipes that I have tried). It’s also where I got my pizza steel that I mentioned in the Jan round-up. Anyway, that’s as good an excuse as any to check out rural Denmark (it’s a city of ~40,000, so perhaps not so rural?). So off we went on a couple of trains:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDenmark, source: Google maps\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nViborg! © 2024.

A big attraction is the contemporary art gallery ARoS – a very distinctive building with its 360° viewing platform that has a rainbow of glass. Overall, a really nice relaxing trip, and it’s good to finally have made it to Jutland (though there’s definitely more to see!). Supposedly there are differences in accent between Jutland and Zealand (island that Copenhagen is on), but I honestly couldn’t tell! Perhaps it’s analogous to the difficulties other have in distinguishing Australian and New Zealand accents.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJust outside the train station.\n© 2024.

This work is openly licensed via CC BY-NC 4.0\n\n\n\n\nInteresting things I’ve read/watched\nI’ve been cooking pasta wrong my entire life.. TLDR: It’s more efficient (time and energy) to start your pasta cold. Pour cold water onto your pasta (only needs to cover by 2-4 cm) and turn on the heat, then cook to your liking.\nJames Shaw (former Green party leader in NZ) gave his leaving parliament speech this month. If you don’t have the time to watch, it’s worth watching or reading the last part (my eyes definitely got a bit wet). Seems like a really decent person – something we definitely need more of in politics.\nKeeping to the NZ theme, here’s another great article from NZ Geographic about invasive pines in NZ. It’s a big problem, and one that needs to be addressed sooner than later. Quite interesting point about how NZ’s stance on genetic modification is stalling the development of sterile pines for the timber industry – which would help a lot with preventing timber industry associated outbreaks.\nAnd some more kiwi stuff… Hayley made a fantastic video about the one of NZ’s Great Walks, the Lake Waikaremoana Track. Featuring a 60-year-old never hiker (her step-mum).\nNot NZ, but continuing on the tree theme, here’s a great piece of video journalism from Vox about the forestry industry in Uruguay. At the start I was a bit sceptical – white guy from U.S.A goes to Uruguay seemingly to solve a mystery from satellite imagery, but it goes much deeper than that.\nAnd lastly, if you’re into video games, here’s a antitrust litigation motion against the company Valve in relation to their video game distribution platform Steam. If you’re a gamer you’ve probably heard of Steam, but you’re probably not aware of the fact that they take a 30% cut on sales. This motion argues that the reason they can get away with this high rate is due to anticompetitive behaviour. It seems that they are intentionally stifling competition to maintain what is essentially a monopoly in the industry. This is usually always bad, as it means that both the consumer and the developer of the games are the ones that are paying for Valve’s immense profits. Gabe Newell (CEO of Valve) is quite happy with the situation, as he supposedly has an armada of super yachts worth ~1 billion USD….\nAntitrust is something that I’m getting increasingly concerned about, so expect some future articles on the topic."

During our time in NZ my grandmother, Helen, passed away. It was quick, and I’m proud of her resolve for leaving on her own terms. She lived a great life and will be missed. While sad, I’m glad we were there to say our goodbyes and to support my mother. Go well, Helen.\n\n\nTaranaki, the mighty maunga (mountain)\nWhile in NZ, we took a weekend trip up to Taranaki (~4 hours’ drive north from the Kapiti Coast). I borrowed mum’s E-Fiat 500 — my first time driving an e-vehicle. It was a lot of fun, and regenerative braking is amazing (converting braking momentum into electricity — and saving your brake pads at the same time). The range is about 250 km, which means stopping at least once along the way. While some may feel inconvenienced by this, I think it’s a great opportunity to visit somewhere that you’d otherwise not bother stopping. The car takes about 20-30 minutes to charge, so ample time for a nice walk and sampling of local cheese scones!\nWe went to visit and stay with my sister Lydia and her family. It was great getting to see the nieces and nephew and to catch up with Lydia and Mu. While there, Lydia took us for a gorgeous hike up Patuha (684 meters) in the Kaitake range (just north of Mount Taranaki). After sorely missing elevation living in Denmark for the past 18 months, it was great to be hiking upwards again.\n\n\n\nMount Taranaki region.\n\n\nMount Taranaki is a dormant volcano, and the second-highest peak in the North Island at 2,518 meters. As you can see from the satellite image, most of the native forest only remains cloaking the mountains and the Kaitake ranges to the north. This is due to national park boundaries, as the region is highly productive for agriculture (mostly dairy) due to the high rainfall and rich volcanic soils. The mountain is a spectacle to behold, and really stands out on the landscape.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMount Taranaki, with snow still on the peak.\n© 2024.

On this trip I went out of my way each evening to try and capture some of the different textures, colours, and luminosity granted by sunset. It was also nice to practice more long exposures with the ND filter and tripod. I hope you enjoy:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n© 2024.

I love the contrast in textures: the smooth curves of the sand, the sharper wave front coming, and the soft silhouette of grass and rock in the foreground. I also like the warm reflections on the sand in contrast to the blue waves. Sometimes its nice to keep an eye out for things other than the horizon when shooting at sunrise/sunset.\n\n\n\n© 2024.

Such retardants are typically impregnated into plastics used for electronics, but when such plastics are recycled into other products they can be a source of exposure to humans (e.g. food contact items, toys). I’ve personally phased out any plastic cookware that touches food, and it’s good (is it really?) to see some evidence to back my choice.\nAnd a nice cynical quote that I think encapsulates our current situation re: big tech and “A.I.”:\n\nOnce men turned their thinking over to machines in the hope that this would set them free. But that only permitted other men with machines to enslave them.\n\n-Frank Herbert (author of Dune)\nFor context, in the books such technology has been banned, which is why there are “mentats” — people who train to be replacements for computers."
