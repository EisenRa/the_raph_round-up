Summer is here! In this round-up I'll share photos from a hike, images from a new ultra wide lens I picked up, and little photo stop from my daily commute.

### Life

Picked a dandelion bloom, took it home, and watched it change:

### Amarminoen -- a long hike

Matilda suggested hiking the Amarmino – a mixture of Amager (the island just East of Copenhagen, and Camino, the long pilgrimage hike in Spain. Little did she know that 27 kilometres is a decent slog, even if the terrain is flat! Overall it was a fantastic outing, the weather was great, and it was great to get out amongst nature. It was also a good limit test – the last 10 km was pretty brutal on the feet, so in the future, conditioning/training would be needed for these distances.

**Practicalities**: it's an easy-to-access hike from Copenhagen. We took a bus from Copenhagen Central Station to Dragør (\~30 minutes) to the start of the trail. The walks concludes at the DR Byen Metro station, which quickly takes you back to the city.

### (Ultra) w i d e angle

I just picked up another Z-mount lens, the Nikon Z 14-30mm f/4 S. This covers the ultra wide angle focal range – which is pretty fun to play around with! With tilting, it can enlarge foregrounds relative to mid/backgrounds (see the first, and the last three images for examples). What better way to test it out than some Copenhagen architecture:

### Bike path photo pit stop 

I'm lucky that part of my commute is along Den Grønne Sti (the green way), a pleasant cycle route through part of Copenhagen. On the way home one day, I decided to make a pit stop to take a few photos. I've no idea what the story behind these towers are:

It's always good to take a moment and appreciate the things you have close to home.

### Photo of the month

Taken on Bryggebroen, a bridge between Amager and Copenhagen, a pedestrian/bike-only bridge. To me, this photo illustrates ones of the best features of living in Copenhagen – the widespread support of cycling infrastructure, and the corresponding uptake in cycling by residents. I'm also very jealous that some kids grow up getting to ride on cargo bikes!
