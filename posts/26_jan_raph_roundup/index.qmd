This post marks the third year of posting the Raph Round-up! I'm glad to be sticking to these monthly posts, and I hope that you enjoy them as much as I enjoy making them.

I know we're well into February, but the reason this January edition is late is that we just came back from a big trip to the southern hemisphere (NZ/Aus). I've got a big backlog of photos that I'm slowly getting through from this trip, which will be coming in the Feb edition. Until then, I thought I'd share some photos from January in a snowy Copenhagen and tropical Singapore.

### A cold winter in Copenhagen

Turns out that it was the coldest January in Denmark for 16 years![^1] I've asked some locals, and they recall much cooler (and snowier) winters when they were growing up – a reminder that we're living through global warming. You may recall that I [remarked (and tested)](https://eisen-raph.com/posts/25_feb_raph_roundup/) that January of last year (2025) felt much warmer than 2024.

While we left for the Southern Hemisphere in January, I still had a couple of wonderful, snow-filled weeks to get out with the camera.

### Snowglobes

I've been really enjoying the 6mm circular fisheye lens lately – here's a winter special:

### Singapore

We stopped in sunny Singapore for a few days on our way to NZ, principally to attend a family wedding. Having only transited through Singapore airport, I was curious to see what this island was like.

The humid, 30°C weather was much welcomed – and I'm pretty sure all the time in the sauna has made me appreciate humid climates more. While it is a small (\~700 square km), yet populous (\~6 million) island, there is more green than your average city. While this greenery doesn't feel 'natural' per se, it has a positive effect on the urban environment.

The diversity of food was amazing – countless independent food markets and stalls, serving a variety (and fusion) of Chinese, Malaysian, and Indian foods. Public transit was also excellent, with an efficient underground metro servicing most of the island.

While purportedly a democracy, Singapore has been governed by a single party (the People's Action Party) since gaining independence in 1965. Some consider this political situation to be "Soft Authoritarianism"[^2]. Some \~40% of residents are not Singaporean citizens[^3], with the majority performing lower-paid work, and the minority "foreign talent" enjoying high pay with generous tax incentives. I feltl that there were a small number of people in Singapore who have A LOT of money, and while the country boasts a high GDP, one gets the sense that this 'wealth' is not so evenly shared.

### Photo of the month

Visually: Closed and fairly balanced composition, contrast between cold and warm, and a person providing a sense of scale.

Symbolically: I'd love to hear your interpretation.

### Interesting things I've read/watched

[Truth](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FyStPztM7eo)?

[Trees. Are. Amazing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pHJIhxZEoxg). I've always had a soft spot for trees after studying plants in university, and this video does a great job of communicating the complexity and splendour of how trees work.

What does gig work, colonialism, and Large Language Models (LLMs) have in common? Excellent pieces ([1](https://privacyinternational.org/explainer/5357/humans-ai-loop-data-labelers-behind-some-most-powerful-llms-training-datasets)) ([2](https://www.technologyreview.com/2022/04/20/1050392/ai-industry-appen-scale-data-labels/)) about how workers from the Global South are exploited by US-led Big Tech for an essential part of LLM training (data labelling).
