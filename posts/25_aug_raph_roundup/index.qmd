As we shift towards autumn, August spells summer's last breaths. I've not had a lot of time for photography this month, but hope you enjoy what moments I captured.

### More summer clouds

Couldn't help myself capturing some more summer clouds:

### Boserup Skov

Took a Sunday trip to Boserup Skov, a forest on the fjord, and a few kilometers northwest of Roskilde.

### Another type of birding

Bird photography: commonly associated with khaki-attired photographers wielding expensive, bazooka-sized lens. These birds don't move, and can be found mostly in urban habitats (from my research, they've also been spotted in other cities). An online search [uncovered an article (in Danish)](https://www.euroman.dk/samfund/far-om-dagen-graffitimaler-om-natten/4733498) about about the aptly named 'Birds Crew' responsible. I'll definitely be keeping an eye on other pieces in the future!

### In the backyard

You don't have to travel to exotic locations to enjoy the process of photography -- a joy of taking frequent walks in your neighbourhood is being present and finding new compositions:

### Photo of the month

Taken in Boserup Skov. I was drawn to the mixture of forest types that created a strong contrast (both texture and light). The repeating lines of imposing dark trunks add interest to the scene.

### Interesting things I've read/watched

What can Magic the Gathering colour system say about humanity? [A lot, apparently](https://homosabiens.substack.com/p/the-mtg-color-wheel). Really neat article! Here's a snippet:

> A world without green, on the other hand, is a world unmoored from reality and disconnected from its own history. It’s a world full of bold schemes that fail to pan out, disasters that take generations to build momentum but are noticed too late. It’s a world where everything is out of place — where nothing truly even has a place — a constant parade of divorces and suicides and famines and extinctions, where things like global warming and eugenics and welfare programs with misaligned incentives happen all the time. It’s a world where the qualities that people derive from Zen Buddhism, or from the contemplation of a sunset, or from a hike in the mountains, or from the embrace of a grandmother, or from the sermon of an ancestor, are all entirely absent. It’s a place where you eat and eat and eat, but you never feel truly full.

[Interesting article](https://www.forkingpaths.co/p/blood-diamonds-and-the-lottery-of-85e?utm_source=post-email-title&publication_id=1184530&post_id=171631292&utm_campaign=email-post-title&isFreemail=true&r=62kytv&triedRedirect=true&utm_medium=email) about how important geography is in shaping history.

[There are projections](https://schaechter.asmblog.org/schaechter/2025/08/the-great-deceleration.html) that we will reach peak human population in this century, which is a good thing if we want to continue to share the planet with other organisms.

Big Tech [obfuscating](https://ketanjoshi.co/2025/08/23/big-techs-selective-disclosure-masks-ais-real-climate-impact/) the energy and water cost of 'AI', and [some journalism](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YN6BEUA4jNU) about how the demand of data centres affects people's electricity bills.

[Excellent video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvaOUFwXjf4) about the history of Google search, and why is sucks now.

[Great video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3YsBZljWOo) about work.

Fly My Pretties released a new album this year, [check it out](https://flymypretties.bandcamp.com/album/elemental?utm_source=album_release&utm_medium=email&utm_content=fanpub_fb&utm_campaign=flymypretties%2Balbum%2Belemental)!
