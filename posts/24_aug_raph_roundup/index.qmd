### Notes from the neighbourhood 

Here are a few August shots from our neighbourhood:

![I think this is a Harefoot mushroom (*Coprinopsis lagopus*). According to Wikipedia, these mushrooms have a very short life, lasting a few hours before dissolving, so I was pretty stoked to see one in such good condition!\

### My first Danish bike packing trip (day 2)

Nyon is a lakeside town about 15 minutes' train ride from Geneva. With beautiful mountain views and access to the lovely Lake Geneva, I can certainly see the appeal of living here. My dad is originally from Geneva, and we had the pleasure of staying with some of his good friends. Great company, wine, food, and weather – an excellent way to end the summer holidays!

### Interesting things I've read/watched

A short history of why [grass lawns are popular](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bR5kIPwg6_Q). Also touches on why they are not the best from an environmental point of view (e.g. water use). More natural approaches can be better for wildlife (e.g. offering shelter, pollination options.).
