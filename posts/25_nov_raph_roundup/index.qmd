As many trees go to slumber (and we say goodbye to leaves until April) I tried to get out and capture the last of Autumn. This edition is a photographic ode to leaves – enjoy!

### Out and about in Autumn

As we moved into November, what few leaves that remained took on vibrant yellows. We had some beautiful sunny days, and our first dusting of snow as the temperature dropped. Dad also visited us for a week, before heading back to the southern hemisphere.

### A sunny day in Dyrehave

I had an absolute blast spending 5-6 hours immersed in the woodland of [Dyrehave](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J%C3%A6gersborg_Dyrehave). Twas a cold, yet sunny day – perfect for capturing the woodlands in the transition from Autumn to Winter. (See the [April edition](https://eisen-raph.com/posts/25_apr_raph_roundup/) for Dyrehave in Spring).

### Autumn's last leaves

Later in the day, there were some absolutely FANTASTIC conditions for capturing the feeling of the end of Autumn. The sun being low on the horizon coupled with the vibrancy of late leaves resulted in some truly remarkable colours and contrast.

### Photo of the month

The vibrancy of the backlit leaves caught my eye and I had to get closer for a shot. I like the balance between the sun star and this one tree that was holding on with its turning leaves, as well as the shadows from the other trees.

### Interesting things I've read/watched

[Dishwasher tips](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DAX2_mPr9W8) from Technology Connections.

[From wool to yarn](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1y8Yq-aYW_w) – quite an amazing process!

[Great write-up](https://www.thebignewsletter.com/p/monopoly-round-up-last-weeks-elections?utm_source=post-email-title&publication_id=11524&post_id=178299879&utm_campaign=email-post-title&isFreemail=false&r=5ols6&triedRedirect=true&utm_medium=email) by Matt Stoller about the AI bubble. [Another push](https://www.bloodinthemachine.com/p/trump-and-big-tech-take-two-more?utm_source=post-email-title&publication_id=1744395&post_id=179479953&utm_campaign=email-post-title&isFreemail=true&r=5ols6&triedRedirect=true&utm_medium=email) to prevent state-led regulation of AI in the U.S.A. [What this could mean for people](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5fsLN69Erg).

AI-slop may account for more than [half of the internet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrTrOCQZoQE).

Need another reason to hate Meta? \~10% of their gross revenue comes from ads for fraudulent goods or scams – they know, and don't care. Cory Doctorow [explains why](https://pluralistic.net/2025/11/08/faecebook/):

> Internally, Meta has made plans to reduce the fraud on the platform, but the effort is being slow-walked because the company estimates that the most it will ultimately pay in fines worldwide ads up to \$1 billion, while it currently books \$7 billion/year in revenue from fraud.

Same news, but in [video format](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8wdS7TTw2w).

[Bernie Sanders (THE G.O.A.T. imo) explains](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-ooIrzy9I&t=1637s) why decisions are made that benefit wealthy people versus the broader public. (2003). \[by controlling the media and dividing people\].

[Resilience over optimisation](https://www.forkingpaths.co/p/against-optimization?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email). A fantastic essay by Brian Klaas about the perils of over-optimisation, and how slack is important. Love the evolutionary biology sprinkled in.

[Capitalism is dying](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqtrNXdlraM) (some would argue it's already dead) – we're moving towards something even more pernicious.
