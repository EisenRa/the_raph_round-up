Welcome to another monthly round-up! This month is more photo heavy than last, so I hope you enjoy some Swedish winter shots. There's also an article about the hallowed Danish rye bread O.o

### Winter holiday in Sweden

Til had the great idea of going for a winter holiday, and I'd also been very eager to explore more of Scandinavia while living in Copenhagen. So we escaped the grey clouds of Copenhagen and took a train to Sweden's capital, Stockholm.

A definite highlight was the mushing (dog sledding). We got to drive a two-person sled, with one person sitting and the other driving. The dogs take care of most of it (they follow the guide's sled), but you have two brakes that you need to apply on downhills / when you want to stop. On the uphills you also hop off and run to help push the sled up. The guides were super nice, and we learned a lot about what it takes to look after and manage mushing dogs. They know each of the \~40 dogs by name, experience, and personality. They have to account for which dogs get along with each other and their relative experience when picking the sled team. The lead (front) dogs also receive special training such that they can make turns on verbal command. It was a fantastic experience, and really made me appreciate how special these animals are.

After three beautiful days in the snow it was time to head home, so we took an hour bus ride to Umeå, where we had a couple of hours before our train to Stockholm. We took a nice walk along the waterfront (ice-front??), and came across a really cool sculpture made by Jaume Plensa. I only took one photo, but it's designed to look similar from different angles, see [here](https://jaumeplensa.com/works-and-projects/public-space/julia-2017) for examples. We then went to a really nice contemporary art museum Bildmuseet, which, as it turns out was designed by the acclaimed Danish [Henning Larsen Architects](https://henninglarsen.com/en/projects/0900-0999/0992-umeaa-kunstmuseum/).

The home leg of our journey took us on a six hour train from Umeå to Stockholm, followed by another night train to Copenhagen, where we arrived around 8 AM. Overall, it's one of the best holidays I've had – it was magical being so far north and seeing so much snow! Train travel is also so much more relaxing than flying, and night trains (if you have a bed) and are a really efficient way to travel.

### Rugbrød (rye bread)

Let's go back to Denmark, and cover a topic that's particularly Danish, namely rugbrød (rye bread).

It's actually quite simple to make compared to a wheat sourdough – where gluten development and shaping is much more important.

Sådan laver du rugbrød (this is how you make ryebread). Once again, I followed a [recipe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgLns9ujYlw) from the excellent [Simpel Sourdough](https://simpelsurdej.dk/). Seeds and cracked rye kernels are soaked overnight to soften, then the next morning this mixture is added to rye flour, sourdough starter, water, salt, and optionally malt syrup/molasses. Let the microbes do their magic (they were super active with this mixture!), then bake. Really nice as toast in the morning with butter and vegemite/cenovis or honey. It's definitely a loaf I'll now be making regularly!

### Photo of the month

### Beer of the month

![To Øl Natur's *Omnipresent*](beer.jpg)

Thought I'd be cheeky and include a new 'Beer of the month' section! This month we have **To Øl Natur's** *Omnipresent*. Really nice balance of sweetness from local honey, *funkiness* from the wild microbes, and fruityness from local cherries. To Øl is a great Danish craft brewery located on Zealand (Eastern most island of Denmark). They have a project **To Øl Natur**, which is all about barrel-aged mixed-fermentation saisons and wild ales. Wild here refers to not inoculating your brew with a specific strain of microbe (e.g. *Saccharomyces cerevisiae* a.k.a brewer's yeast), but opening the door to other microbes. This usually results in super interesting flavours -- but I'll cover this in a future post :)
