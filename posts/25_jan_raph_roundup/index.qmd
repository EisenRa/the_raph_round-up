### Falling leaves

As with Spring, Autumn's influence on the landscape is far more evident up north compared to my time living in Australia/NZ. As the trees prepare for the long winter to come, we're witness to some vibrant colours and textures.

### A closer look at fall

Moving from the scale of trees to a closer look at Autumn's influence on the landscape. From fungi spreading spores to squirrels making their last minute preparations.

### From falling leaves to falling snow

We also had a weekend with a dusting of snow. I took this opportunity to head north to Gribskov forest, and was extremely glad that I did so. It was magical being in such a magical environment. Cycling through snow was a first, and a bit sketchy at times, but I'm grateful for my past mountain biking experience!

### The lake

Neslted within Gribskov is Gribsø, a lake. The conditions were great for photography (still, partly cloudly), and it was a stunning walk around the lake, with plently of stops with the camera.

### Photo of the month

A naked tree's reflection in the lake, with its leaves discarded on the lake bed. I love the subtle transition between lake bed, lake, and the sky's reflection.
