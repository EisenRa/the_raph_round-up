Happy new year! It's the end of January 2025 as I'm writing this, and day light has already increased by \~ 1 hour and 38 minutes since the solstice! It's enough to make it feel like we're not in the depths of darkness any more, and each day is just a little bit longer.

### Snow and sun

After surviving the barrage of illegal fireworks in Copenhagen on NYE, we had a nice dusting of snow (and some rare winter sunshine!), so off it was with the camera to take some snaps of the local neighbourhood. Most of my favourites from this outing were in portrait orientation, which is quite unusual for me.

### Snowy forest

With the snow, we also hopped on a train north to Gribskov (featured in November 2024 round-up) to take advantage of the winter vibes.

### Moody mist

I've never seen mist and snow together, and love the moody feeling it gives the landscape:

### A train trip

We also had a short trip to Italy (Florence) in early January to catch up with some family, and caught the night train back from Zurich to Hamburg!

![One of the only shots I was happy with in Florence – urban photography is hard! I guess I also feel a lot more inspired/receptive to details when I'm out in nature.\

![The [Milan central station](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milano_Centrale_railway_station) is quite something. Enormous halls (one is 74 metres high!) erected during Mussolini's reign. The goal I guess was to show that the Facist government could get stuff done. Note also the Roman-inspired iconography: S.P.Q.R (*Senatus Populusque Romanus*: The Senate and the People of Rome). To the right, we have [Romulus and Remus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romulus_and_Remus) and the wolf. My guess is that this iconography was used by the facists as a means to get people exited about a new Italian empire..\

### Photo of the month

First portrait FOTM! Can you guess what's going on here?

By flipping the image, I think it creates an illusion (at least at first glance) that it's the night due to the water being darker than the sky. You then see the frozen reeds and realise that the image is actually flipped. The water is not exactly mirror-like, due to some ducks swimming around :-)

### Interesting things I've read/watched

A [nice vid](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ni82f1-cAXg) from the Veritasium channel about the history and uses of super glue. As well as tips for what to do if you get some on your skin.

Other big news is the release of a large language model from a Chinese company, DeepSeek. Apparently, its release led to some pretty large losses in the U.S. market (potentially \~1 trillion), though you wont see me shedding any tears about this. [Here's a vid](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gY4Z-9QlZ64) about what it is, and why its caused such an upstir. And [here's one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uidm8AKdhug) discussing its impact on geopolitics/markets.

Not released in Jan, but here's [the latest release](https://thieverycorporation.bandcamp.com/album/symphonik-2) by Thievery Corporation (one of my fav. music groups). It's such a great varied mix of musical genres and often political prose.

And perhaps my favourite pick of the month: [a 10-part series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ij5WAm05OEE) by Elina Osborne documenting her time on the Te Araroa trail (the \~3,000 km trail from the top to the bottom of New Zealand). Wow, I'm blown away by Elina's story telling and cinematography. Its left me inspired to 1) do the Te Araroa trail one day, and 2) work on developing some videography skills.
