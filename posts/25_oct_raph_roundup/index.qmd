And so Autumn rolls in, transforming life.

### Change is in the air (literally)

With temperatures dropping to the low teens and the days shortening, we're well and truly in the midst of Autumn:

### Fisheye

I picked up a new lens – a 6mm(!) circular fisheye with a whopping 220 degrees field of view. It's a lot of fun to use, and a real challenge to embrace the distortion when composing shots (and keeping your fingers out of the frame, which I didn't manage to do on some of the shots 😆).

### Hareskov (Autumn edition)

It's a joy coming back to a location and seeing it transform as the seasons change. Here I took advantage of an unusually sunny day to visit Hareskov again ([last time I visited in the peak of summer](https://eisen-raph.com/posts/25_july_raph_roundup/)). Had a great day capturing the yellows of Autumn, and getting low to the ground to capture some of the smaller features in the forest.

### ICM in the forest

While this acronym may sound like a recreational drug, and the resulting images may look a tad trippy, ICM stands for **I**ntentional **C**amera **M**ovement, and is a photographic technique whereby blur is introduced by moving the camera while the shutter open. I honestly had a LOT of fun taking these shots, and really like how some of them came out.
