November was great for photography here in Copenhagen. We got back in time to witness Autumn's influence on the trees, and had a few days of snow. So enjoy photos from two seasons in a month!

### Falling leaves

As with Spring, Autumn's influence on the landscape is far more evident up north compared to my time living in Australia/NZ. As the trees prepare for the long winter to come, we're witness to some vibrant colours and textures.

### A closer look at fall

Moving from the scale of trees to a closer look at Autumn's influence on the landscape. From fungi spreading spores to squirrels making their last minute preparations.

### From falling leaves to falling snow

We also had a weekend with a dusting of snow. I took this opportunity to head north to Gribskov forest, and was extremely glad that I did so. It was magical being in such a magical environment. Cycling through snow was a first, and a bit sketchy at times, but I'm grateful for my past mountain biking experience!

### The lake

Neslted within Gribskov is Gribsø, a lake. The conditions were great for photography (still, partly cloudly), and it was a stunning walk around the lake, with plently of stops with the camera.

### Photo of the month

A naked tree's reflection in the lake, with its leaves discarded on the lake bed. I love the subtle transition between lake bed, lake, and the sky's reflection.

### Interesting things I've read/watched

If all the blood vessels in the human body were put together, could they span >100,000 km? [Great video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgo7rm5Maqg) about how "facts", by virtue of merely being repeated, come to be known as truth. To me it speaks to the value of questioning assumptions and searching for sources. 

[An excellent video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zB_OApdxcno) about how we process knowledge in light of our political views. 

[Google is a monopoly](https://www.thebignewsletter.com/p/the-proposal-to-break-up-google-is?utm_source=post-email-title&publication_id=11524&post_id=151982017&utm_campaign=email-post-title&isFreemail=false&r=5ols6&triedRedirect=true&utm_medium=email), and there are some proposals to fix it. Given the power and reach of the tech giant this will be a tough job. 

[Why self-driving cars](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=040ejWnFkj0) are probably not a good idea for future urban planning. Long video, but well-researched and worth the watch. 

[A positive story](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Boi0XEm9-4E) about how Utrecht went from car-dominated to perhaps the best cycling city in the world. To me it's clear how living in a cycle-friendly city has massive benefits for people's health and well being. Though I'm reminded of this quote by one 15th century Italian philosopher/cynic:

> “It must be considered that there is nothing more difficult to carry out … than to initiate a new order of things; for the reformer has enemies in all those who profit by the old order, and only lukewarm defenders in all those who would profit by the new order; this lukewarmness arising partly from the incredulity of mankind who does not truly believe in anything new until they actually have experience of it.”

—Niccolò Machiavelli
