It’s a few months overdue, but better late than never!

### Summer + Netherlands + Family = Cycling

July in Denmark is a time for summer holidays (sommerferie). Many Danes flock to other countries to absorb some much-needed sun and work on their tans. I personally feel that summer in Denmark is close to perfect – temperatures of low to mid-twenties – and I can’t comprehend why some travel to Spain in summer to melt in 30-40+ temps. This year, we spent a couple of weeks in Utrecht, the Netherlands, to meet up with some family visiting from New Zealand. Growing up, holidays in my family always involved hopping on what is perhaps one of the greatest inventions in human history – the bicycle. What better place to continue this tradition than the Netherlands, a country widely recognised as a nation of cyclists? Here are some photos from our time there (see the captions on each photo for details).

![I was amazed at how lush the Netherlands felt in summer. There are many artificial rivers that span the countryside. Some even use these artificial bodies of water instead of fences for their properties. The downside here, of course, is that water = mosquitoes!\

![The Veluwe was absolutely amazing. It's a region of \~1,100 square kilometres containing multiple national parks/reserves. We only briefly visited, but I can definitely see myself going back for a longer stay to photograph the diverse landscapes within. Apparently some wolves were even reintroduced in the northern region in 2019, as a means of rewilding/restoring the ecosystem.\

Given that I currently live in a country also renowned for its cycling – Denmark – you may be asking: “Raph, what country does cycling better, the Netherlands or Denmark?”. I’m going to hold you in suspense, because for the August Round-Up there’ll be an article about my first bike-packing adventure in Denmark! So were I writing this in July, this foreshadowing would not be possible :-)

### Street art, but not on the street???

While in the Netherlands, we also visited the STRAAT museum – a huge collection of street art housed in a neat old industrial building.

### More cowbell?

Before heading back to Copenhagen, we decided to spend five days in Switzerland. We took the Nightjet (overnight train) from Amsterdam to Basel, followed by a beautiful train ride from Basel to Nyon in western Switzerland, close to Geneva. You can't go to Switzerland without enjoying some hiking, so here are some photos from a day hike to La Dôle peak (1,677 metres) in the Juras. The weather was absolutely fantastic -- 25+ in Nyon, but cooler in the higher altitudes of the Juras.

### Swiss lake life

Nyon is a lakeside town about 15 minutes' train ride from Geneva. With beautiful mountain views and access to the lovely Lake Geneva, I can certainly see the appeal of living here. My dad is originally from Geneva, and we had the pleasure of staying with some of his good friends. Great company, wine, food, and weather – an excellent way to end the summer holidays!

### Photo of the month

A side view of La Dôle. I find the perspective and scale really interesting.

### Interesting things I've read/watched

A short history of why [grass lawns are popular](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bR5kIPwg6_Q). Also touches on why they are not the best from an environmental point of view (e.g. water use). More natural approaches can be better for wildlife (e.g. offering shelter, pollination options.).

[Yes Australia's environment is on a depressing path, but 7 billion a year would transform it](https://theconversation.com/yes-australias-environment-is-on-a-depressing-path-but-7-billion-a-year-would-transform-it-235305). A summary article about a report costing approaches for restoring/improving Australia's environment. Aus as a nation is definitely wealthy enough to afford this -- for comparison, [fossil fuel producers were subsidised ~14 billion from 2023-2024!](https://australiainstitute.org.au/report/fossil-fuel-subsidies-in-australia-2024/). If only we could get our priorities right..
