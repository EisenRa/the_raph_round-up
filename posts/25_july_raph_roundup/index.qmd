July means summer in the northern hemisphere – a time for getting out and enjoying life. You'll find a lot of insects in this month's Round-Up!

I've also written a [statement on AI use](../../ai_statement.qmd), and share my thoughts on the latest craze.

### Make honey while the sun shines

What better way to start the July issue than with the quintessential summer colour, yellow:

### Summer clouds

In contrast the the single, featureless cloud that seems to cover Copenhagen for most of winter, in summer we have some magnificent cumulonimbus clouds (skybrud -- or cloudbursts). They make forecasting quite a challenge for the local meteorological institute, and result highly local and intense showers. I've also taken a number of timelapses which I'll share at a later date.

### Summer woodlands

Had a wonderful bike ride in Jægersborg Dyrehave -- a short train ride from Copenhagen.

### More summer forest in Hareskov

Another great forest accessible from Copenhagen's suburban train is Hareskov. Had a lovely day exploring nature (whilst avoiding the many mosquitos!)

### Summer is Sweden

We also took the train to Gothenburg for a long weekend, and also took a ferry ride to the island of Vrångö for a coastal hike.

### Photo of the month

On my trip to Hareskov I came across this amazing lighting. When it's sunny, the lighting in the forest can be a bit harsh, but in this case, it was bright and overcast, resulting in a softer feel.

### Interesting things I've read/watched

[Excellent photo portfolio](https://www.ericpickersgill.com/removed) about the attention-seeking device that most of us own!

[Big Tech doing the usual shit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUfSl2fZ_E8).

[The sound of ants](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHVAbwOt8E0)! George Vlad records amazing soundscapes (particularly of remote wilderness). It's amazing what's out there when you stop and listen. [Check out his site](https://mindful-audio.com/). And [here's an interview](https://earth.fm/podcast/interview-george-vlad/) where they discuss field recording, and why it's important to be present and listen. I think I'll one day get into field recording – it pairs nicely with photography too :)

Matilda went on a bit of a Crufts dog freestyle binge, and [shared this impressive routine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&v=2-KKdxEdk3Y).

[Some expert opinions](https://www.sciencemediacentre.co.nz/2025/07/09/moa-de-extinction-plans-announced-expert-reaction/) on Colossus' Moa "de-extinction" plans. As a biologist, I'm also highly critical of Colossus. I don't think de-extinction is actually possible (at least not in the short/mid-term). I also think that it sets a bad precedence – why bother protecting our current biodiversity when we can just "create" it in the lab..

If you have a couple of hours, I can highly recommend this two-part documentary on the GameStop saga. A movement against Wall Street, or a cult? Absolutely fascinating. ([part 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LPuXowifJ4), [part 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5Bd6YxifCo)).

[Short BBC documentary](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=596dU6pDEU8) on the degrowth movement.

[Great essay](https://www.thebignewsletter.com/p/the-number-go-up-rule-why-america?utm_source=post-email-title&publication_id=11524&post_id=168396972&utm_campaign=email-post-title&isFreemail=false&r=5ols6&triedRedirect=true&utm_medium=email) by Matt Stoller about our (or our economic system's) fetish with growth.

[The Death of the Student Essay](https://www.forkingpaths.co/p/the-death-of-the-student-essayand). Excellent essay on "AI" use, and what it may mean for human cognition.

*Organised Money* podcast about Multi Level Marketing (a.k.a. pyramid schemes), interviewing Bridget Read, who recently wrote the book '[Little Bosses Everywhere, How the Pyramid Scheme Shaped America](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/715421/little-bosses-everywhere-by-bridget-read/)'. It's quite shocking how entrenched pyramid schemes are in the U.S.

[Based monologue](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOTAdvc1MJM) (from 20 years ago) that's grown even more relevant as time has gone by.
