# UNDER CONSTRUCTION

Photography is a passion that I've been cultivating over the past decade. To me, the camera is a tool for being present in the moment and mindful of the beauty in the world. As a trained biologist, my photography is principally inspired by the wonders of nature. Though I don't shy from finding interesting compositions and textures in the built environment 😉.

See below some galleries by category. I also post a \[monthly photo blog\](index.qmd). If you come across an image that speaks to you and would like to purchase a print, feel free to visit the \[shop\](shop.qmd) or \[reach out to me directly\](about.qmd).
