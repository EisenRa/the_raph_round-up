<p>Welcome to another monthly round-up! You may have noticed that we have a new URL – I ended up buying a domain name and email server, so there’s now an option to sign up to a mailing list if you want updates when new round-ups are published (see bottom of page).</p>
<p>This month is more photo heavy than last, so I hope you enjoy some Swedish winter shots. There’s also an article about the hallowed Danish rye bread O.o</p>

<p>Matilda had the great idea of going for a winter holiday, and I’d also been very eager to explore more of Scandinavia while living in Copenhagen. So we packed our bags and escaped the grey clouds of Copenhagen and took a ~6-hour train to Sweden’s capital, Stockholm. Stockholm (circa 1 million people) definitely has a bigger city feel compared to Copenhagen (circa 600,000). IMO Copenhagen feels a bit cosier, and easier to get around with amazing cycling infrastructure. Still we had a really nice time walking around, thrift-shopping, and tasting baked Swedish delicacies. We also visited a cool photography museum (Fotografiska) that was quite inspiring!</p>

<p>The next leg of the journey took us circa 600 kilometres north, to a latitude of ~64°N! Adelaide by comparison is ~35°S (Wellington ~41°S) – so much closer to a pole than we’ve ever been before. We took a sleeper cabin in a night train (see photo), which was a really fun experience, before arriving at our destination at around 9 AM. Granö is a small rural town of roughy 200 inhabitants, and home to <a href="https://granobeckasin.com/en/about-grano-beckasin/">Granö Beckasin</a>, a cosy hotel and destination. Here we stayed in a hyggelig cabin, went for hikes in the snow, cross-country skied, and did mushing (dog sledding)! They also had a sauna and hole in the ice for winter bathing. We did plan to go for a northern lights tour, but alas it was cloudy on the night (good excuse to go back up north again!). Overall it was a really nice stay, and Granö Beckasin definitely seems to be accomplishing what they set out to do – making Granö a holiday destination and in doing so keeping the town alive.</p>

<p>A definite highlight for me was the mushing (dog sledding). We got to drive a two-person sled, with one person sitting and the other driving. The dogs take care of most of it (they follow the guide’s sled), but you have two brakes that you need to apply on downhills or when you want to stop. On the uphills, you also hop off and run to help push the sled up. The guides were super nice, and we learned a lot about what it takes to look after and manage mushing dogs. They know each of the ~40 dogs by name, experience, and personality. They have to account for which dogs get along with each other and their relative experience when picking the sled team. The lead (front) dogs also receive special training such that they can make turns on verbal command. It was a fantastic experience, and really made me appreciate how special these animals are.</p>

<p>After three beautiful days in the snow it was time to head home, so we took an hour’s bus ride to Umeå, where we had a few hours to kill before our train back to Stockholm. We took a nice walk along the waterfront (ice-front??), and came across a really cool sculpture made by Jaume Plensa. I only took one photo, but it’s designed to look similar from different angles, see <a href="https://jaumeplensa.com/works-and-projects/public-space/julia-2017">here</a> for examples. We then went to a really nice contemporary art museum, Bildmuseet, which as it turns out was designed by the acclaimed Danish <a href="https://henninglarsen.com/en/projects/0900-0999/0992-umeaa-kunstmuseum/">Henning Larsen Architects</a>.</p>

<p>The home leg of our journey took us on a six-hour train from Umeå to Stockholm, followed by another night train to Copenhagen, where we arrived around 8 AM. Overall, it’s one of the best holidays I’ve had – it was magical being so far north and seeing so much snow! Train travel is also so much more relaxing than flying, and night trains (if you have a bed) are a really comfortable and efficient way to travel.</p>

<section id="rugbrød-rye-bread" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="rugbrød-rye-bread">Rugbrød (rye bread)</h3>
<p>Let’s go back to Denmark, and cover a topic that’s particularly Danish, namely <strong>rugbrød</strong> (rye bread). Most Danes consume rugbrød every day – typically for lunch – and I reckon it’s the secret to their height and overall health :-) It’s high in fibre and extremely nutritious. Danes and rye (<em>Secale cereale</em>) go back at least 1,000 years, and my understanding is that it was more cold-tolerant than wheat, hence its popularity up here. A classic Danish food is <strong>smørrebrød</strong> (translates to butter bread), an open-faced rugbrød sandwich. This can be as simple as rugbrød with whatever toppings/leftovers you happen to have in the fridge, or a fancy version offered by one of the many smørrebrød establishments in the city (see photos).</p>
<p>In Feb I tried making rugbrød for the first time – mostly to practice for when I head back to Aus/NZ one day (it’s really hard to find there). My undertanding is that all rugbrød is made with sourdough due to the <a href="https://www.thefreshloaf.com/handbook/rye-flour">special characteristics of rye flour.</a> Rye has a much lower quantity of gluten than wheat, relying instead on pentosans (polymers of 5-carbon sugar) for texture. Rye also typically has a much higher (and more active) amylase content (enzyme that splits amylose into simple sugars). This is where the sourdough comes in, as the acidity lowers the amylase activity – preventing all the amylose from being chewed up, which would result in a gummy texture. I honestly found it much easier than my usual wheat sourdough loaf, though maybe I got lucky with the fermentation timing!</p>

<p>Sådan laver du rugbrød (this is how you make rye bread). Once again, I followed a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgLns9ujYlw">recipe</a> from the excellent <a href="https://simpelsurdej.dk/">Simpel Sourdough</a>. Seeds and cracked rye kernels are soaked overnight to soften, then the next morning this mixture is added to rye flour, sourdough starter, water, salt, and optionally malt syrup/molasses. Let the microbes do their magic (they were super active with this mixture!), then bake. Really nice as toast in the morning with butter and Vegemite/Cenovis or honey. It’s definitely a loaf I’ll now be making regularly, and a nice recipe to bring back to Aus/NZ one day.</p>

<p>The days are getting longer (finally!) Presently, the days are 4 hours and 22 minutes longer than at the winter solstice, which makes a huge difference! Sunrise is at roughly 6:40, and sunset is at roughly 18:00, so we’re over the worst of the darkness. We’ve even got some brave plants that are bringing some colour to the landscape (despite the fact that it’s 2 degrees C as I’m writing this!):</p>

<p>Thought I’d be cheeky and include a new ‘Beer of the month’ section! This month we have <strong>To Øl Natur’s</strong> <em>Omnipresent</em>. Really nice balance of sweetness from local honey, <em>funkiness</em> from the wild microbes, and fruitiness from local cherries. To Øl is a great Danish craft brewery located on Zealand (easternmost island of Denmark, where Copenhagen is also found). They have a project, <strong>To Øl Natur</strong>, which is all about barrel-aged mixed-fermentation saisons and wild ales. Wild here refers to not inoculating your brew with a specific strain of microbe (e.g.&nbsp;<em>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</em> AKA brewer’s yeast), but opening the door to other microbes. This usually results in super interesting flavours – but I’ll cover this in a future post :)</p>

<section id="huh" class="level3 page-columns page-full">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="huh">Huh?</h3>
<p>A resolution I made this year is to write a short summary of each month, for posterity, and for sharing with friends and family. You may be thinking, huh, why? Well, I have a few reasons:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>I’m pretty terrible at keeping in touch with people overseas, and given that I now live in Denmark, this could be a nice way of letting you know what’s going on; and</li>
<li>I think it will be a nice exercise of self-reflection – something that I don’t do enough of.</li>
<li>It’s also a great opportunity for me to learn some quarto/css, which is what I’ll be using to create/format these posts.</li>
</ol>
<div class="page-columns page-full"><p></p><div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container"><span class="margin-aside">If you’re curious as to how I made this blog for free, check out the <a href="https://quarto.org/docs/websites/website-blog.html">quarto guide</a></span></div></div>
<p>So if you’re reading this, velkommen to the first instalment! I’ll try to keep these succinct and full of photos (you may even learn something about Danish culture). In addition, I’ll have a ‘photo-of-the-month’ section at the end (taken with my camera).</p>

<p>Actually, it’s more like bangs for a whole week leading up to NYE. For some reason, Danes light a lot of fireworks. According to DR (the national broadcaster), <strong>500 million DKK</strong> (111 million AUD) is spent annually on personal fireworks. That’s a lot for a country of 5.8 million, and doesn’t include the estimated 1.7 tonnes of illegally imported fireworks. Growing up as a kid in NZ, I remember getting a small pack to light for one night (Guy Fawkes). However, here, fireworks are legal to purchase from the 15<sup>th</sup> of December, but <em>only</em> to fire from the 28<sup>th</sup> of December – 1<sup>st</sup> of January. The reality is that people are lighting them weeks leading up to NYE (due to a lack of enforcement) – and they are way louder than what we had in NZ (it’s basically military-grade ordinance). Even with the excellent building insulation in Denmark (we have triple-glazing), you can still hear bozos lighting them at 11 PM on a weeknight…</p>

</div></div><p>It looks like public opinion is changing, with &gt;50% of surveyed Danes supporting a ban on personal firework usage (<a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1428869/attitudes-towards-ban-on-fireworks-in-denmark/">ref</a>). In addition, the government is looking to restrict personal usage to between the 31<sup>st</sup> of December and 1<sup>st</sup> of January for 2024-2025. Though I’m not confident that this will be enforced. Perhaps I should have brought my 600 mm telescopic lens with me to Denmark to catch people in the act?

<p>What the heck is a Fastelavnbolle (and how do you even pronounce it)? For this piece, I’m bringing in my historical and cultural correspondent (<strong>Dr Matilda Handsley-Davis</strong>) for some background on this tasty topic:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Fastelavn is a Danish festival with Christian roots. It’s part of the same tradition as Carnival or Mardi Gras – a chance to indulge in some excess just before the start of Lent. Unsurprisingly, fatty and sugary treats play a large role in this indulgence – hence, the Fastelavnsbolle (Fastelavn bun). A ‘gammeldags’ (‘olden days’) version is a sweet, yeasted bun filled with marzipan and/or whipped cream, topped with chocolate icing.</p>

<p>However, Danish bakeries nowadays (maybe especially in Copenhagen?) are engaged in an annual arms race to create the most popular, delicious, or outrageous combinations of pastries, fillings, and flavours. Croissant dough, berries, citrus curd, and mascarpone are some popular avant-garde ingredients. Some bakeries also dabble in the Swedish version, ‘semla’ – a soft, cardamom-spiced bun with roasted almonds and a lot of whipped cream. While the diversity is exciting, having now tasted about six or seven different varieties across this and last year, I would actually say that a good-quality gammeldags number is hard to beat.</p>

<p>The actual day of Fastelavn is seven weeks before Easter Sunday, so it always falls in February or early March – but the boller seem to hit the shelves as soon as everyone has recovered from New Year’s Eve. It’s surely not a coincidence that the season for this ultimate comfort food falls in a gloomy and dark time of year when everyone’s a bit sick of winter.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Interestingly, Fastelavn also bears quite a few similarities to Halloween. Kids traditionally dress up in costumes and go from house to house singing and asking for Fastelavnsboller. If they don’t get them, they may ‘make trouble’ – so kind of the Danish version of trick-or-treating. Children may also gather to ‘hit the cat out of the barrel’ with sticks – now a kind of pinata filled with lollies and maybe a paper cat. Back in the day, the tradition was quite a bit darker – an actual cat, symbolising the Devil, would be put into an actual barrel and set upon by people bearing sticks. This was supposed to symbolise driving evil away.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>To finish up, here is an approximate phonetic pronunciation guide for ‘Fastelavnsbolle’: fess-tuh-lowns-boh-luh (the ‘ow’ as in ‘how’ or ‘clown’)</p>

<div class="page-columns page-full"><p> I love pizza, but making a good pie at home is tough without a speciality pizza oven. A key element is the high heat required to cook said pizzas quickly – allowing for the base to be properly cooked, and for a nice spring in the crust. Years ago I previously tried a pizza stone but found it still wasn’t getting hot enough or cooking the pizzas quickly – ending my hopes of making good pies at home. Flash forward to 2023, when I came across <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MH-EClQB8As">a video</a> by <a href="https://simpelsurdej.dk/">simpel dourdough</a> demonstrating the use of a steel for making pizza.

<p>I guess steel is far more conductive than stone, so the heat transfer to the pizza is much higher. The first two pizzas were cooked back-to-back, and took only 3.5 minutes each! I’m using a sourdough (66% hydration), cold fermenting in the fridge for 1-7 days. It’s actually a super convenient weeknight meal. I make the dough on the weekend, and on the night just need to fire up the oven, shape, top, and bake!
