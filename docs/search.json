    "text": "Welcome to another monthly round-up! You may have noticed that we have a new URL – I ended up buying a domain name and email server, so there’s now an option to sign up to a mailing list if you want updates when new round-ups are published (see bottom of page).\nThis month is more photo heavy than last, so I hope you enjoy some Swedish winter shots. There’s also an article about the hallowed Danish rye bread O.o\n\nWinter holiday in Sweden\nMatilda had the great idea of going for a winter holiday, and I’d also been very eager to explore more of Scandinavia while living in Copenhagen. So we packed our bags and escaped the grey clouds of Copenhagen and took a ~6-hour train to Sweden’s capital, Stockholm. Stockholm (circa 1 million people) definitely has a bigger city feel compared to Copenhagen (circa 600,000). IMO Copenhagen feels a bit cosier, and easier to get around with amazing cycling infrastructure. Still we had a really nice time walking around, thrift-shopping, and tasting baked Swedish delicacies. We also visited a cool photography museum (Fotografiska) that was quite inspiring!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChilly in Stockholm!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDjurgården, an island in Stockholm that was previously the Swedish royal family’s private getaway.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSemla – the Swedish equivalent of the fastelavnsbolle we covered last month. Filled with cream, almonds, and almond paste. (You can also spot a humble kanelbulle – cinnamon bun – in the background).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHad the pleasure of visiting one of the Omnipollo bars – a really good Swedish craft brewery.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe next leg of the journey took us circa 600 kilometres north, to a latitude of ~64°N! Adelaide by comparison is ~35°S (Wellington ~41°S) – so much closer to a pole than we’ve ever been before. We took a sleeper cabin in a night train (see photo), which was a really fun experience, before arriving at our destination at around 9 AM. Granö is a small rural town of roughy 200 inhabitants, and home to Granö Beckasin, a cosy hotel and destination. Here we stayed in a hyggelig cabin, went for hikes in the snow, cross-country skied, and did mushing (dog sledding)! They also had a sauna and hole in the ice for winter bathing. We did plan to go for a northern lights tour, but alas it was cloudy on the night (good excuse to go back up north again!). Overall it was a really nice stay, and Granö Beckasin definitely seems to be accomplishing what they set out to do – making Granö a holiday destination and in doing so keeping the town alive.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur destination: Granö.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCozy train sleeper cabin! Second bed folds out and acts as a bunk.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nArrived in Granö!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMost of the buildings in Granö are warmly coloured, makes for a nice contrast to the whites and blues!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nView from our cabin at Granö Beckasin\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCozy cabin in the woods (not currently in use).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSaid cabin up close.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrozen river in Granö – we went cross-country skiing on top of it. The ice is more than one metre thick.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSunset in Granö.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSunset in Granö 2.\n\n\n\n\n\nA definite highlight for me was the mushing (dog sledding). We got to drive a two-person sled, with one person sitting and the other driving. The dogs take care of most of it (they follow the guide’s sled), but you have two brakes that you need to apply on downhills or when you want to stop. On the uphills, you also hop off and run to help push the sled up. The guides were super nice, and we learned a lot about what it takes to look after and manage mushing dogs. They know each of the ~40 dogs by name, experience, and personality. They have to account for which dogs get along with each other and their relative experience when picking the sled team. The lead (front) dogs also receive special training such that they can make turns on verbal command. It was a fantastic experience, and really made me appreciate how special these animals are.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDog sledding! #1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTuckered out dogs after the ride ready for a pat. They are really cuddly after a good run.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDoggo\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter three beautiful days in the snow it was time to head home, so we took an hour’s bus ride to Umeå, where we had a few hours to kill before our train back to Stockholm. We took a nice walk along the waterfront (ice-front??), and came across a really cool sculpture made by Jaume Plensa. I only took one photo, but it’s designed to look similar from different angles, see here for examples. We then went to a really nice contemporary art museum, Bildmuseet, which as it turns out was designed by the acclaimed Danish Henning Larsen Architects.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJULIA 2017\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA view from Umeå’s contemporary art museum, Bildmuseet.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnother view from Umeå’s contemporary art museum, Bildmuseet.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBildmuseet interior.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBildmuseet interior 2.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLove the textures and angles in this photo.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe home leg of our journey took us on a six-hour train from Umeå to Stockholm, followed by another night train to Copenhagen, where we arrived around 8 AM. Overall, it’s one of the best holidays I’ve had – it was magical being so far north and seeing so much snow! Train travel is also so much more relaxing than flying, and night trains (if you have a bed) are a really comfortable and efficient way to travel.\n\n\nRugbrød (rye bread)\nLet’s go back to Denmark, and cover a topic that’s particularly Danish, namely rugbrød (rye bread). Most Danes consume rugbrød every day – typically for lunch – and I reckon it’s the secret to their height and overall health :-) It’s high in fibre and extremely nutritious. Danes and rye (Secale cereale) go back at least 1,000 years, and my understanding is that it was more cold-tolerant than wheat, hence its popularity up here. A classic Danish food is smørrebrød (translates to butter bread), an open-faced rugbrød sandwich. This can be as simple as rugbrød with whatever toppings/leftovers you happen to have in the fridge, or a fancy version offered by one of the many smørrebrød establishments in the city (see photos).\nIn Feb I tried making rugbrød for the first time – mostly to practice for when I head back to Aus/NZ one day (it’s really hard to find there). My undertanding is that all rugbrød is made with sourdough due to the special characteristics of rye flour. Rye has a much lower quantity of gluten than wheat, relying instead on pentosans (polymers of 5-carbon sugar) for texture. Rye also typically has a much higher (and more active) amylase content (enzyme that splits amylose into simple sugars). This is where the sourdough comes in, as the acidity lowers the amylase activity – preventing all the amylose from being chewed up, which would result in a gummy texture. I honestly found it much easier than my usual wheat sourdough loaf, though maybe I got lucky with the fermentation timing!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMy first rugbrød bake!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFancy Danish Smørrebrød #1 (https://copenhagenfood.dk/aamanns-etablissement/).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFancy Danish Smørrebrød #2 (https://migogkbh.dk/aamanns-aabner-nyt-sted/).\n\n\n\n\n\nSådan laver du rugbrød (this is how you make rye bread). Once again, I followed a recipe from the excellent Simpel Sourdough. Seeds and cracked rye kernels are soaked overnight to soften, then the next morning this mixture is added to rye flour, sourdough starter, water, salt, and optionally malt syrup/molasses. Let the microbes do their magic (they were super active with this mixture!), then bake. Really nice as toast in the morning with butter and Vegemite/Cenovis or honey. It’s definitely a loaf I’ll now be making regularly, and a nice recipe to bring back to Aus/NZ one day.\n\n\nSpring is slowly making itself known\nThe days are getting longer (finally!) Presently, the days are 4 hours and 22 minutes longer than at the winter solstice, which makes a huge difference! Sunrise is at roughly 6:40, and sunset is at roughly 18:00, so we’re over the worst of the darkness. We’ve even got some brave plants that are bringing some colour to the landscape (despite the fact that it’s 2 degrees C as I’m writing this!):\n\n\n\nPioneering snowdrop! One of the first flowers to start blooming in the Danish spring.\n\n\n\n\nPhoto of the month\n\n\n\nLonely bicycle in Umeå. Sums up how much snow we saw in Sweden! 35mm, ISO 100, f / 3.2, 1/1600 sec\n\n\n\n\nBeer of the month\n\n\n\nTo Øl Natur’s Omnipresent\n\n\nThought I’d be cheeky and include a new ‘Beer of the month’ section! This month we have To Øl Natur’s Omnipresent. Really nice balance of sweetness from local honey, funkiness from the wild microbes, and fruitiness from local cherries. To Øl is a great Danish craft brewery located on Zealand (easternmost island of Denmark, where Copenhagen is also found). They have a project, To Øl Natur, which is all about barrel-aged mixed-fermentation saisons and wild ales. Wild here refers to not inoculating your brew with a specific strain of microbe (e.g. Saccharomyces cerevisiae AKA brewer’s yeast), but opening the door to other microbes. This usually results in super interesting flavours – but I’ll cover this in a future post :)\n\n\nInteresting things I’ve read/watched\nStory about why blue LEDs were so hard to make – and why cracking this was so important for more efficient lighting + most screens that we now use. Veritasium is an amazing science communicator, and I recommend checking out his other stuff if you haven’t already.\nRichard Dennis’ speech to the National Press Club. Richard (from the Australia Institute) is a national treasure, and I love how he calls out bullshit in simple terms.\n\nIn Norway they tax the fossil fuel industry and they give university education to their kids for free. In Australia we subsidise the fossil fuel industry and we charge our kids a fortune to go to uni. The Australian government collects more money from HECS [student loan system] than it does from the petroleum resource rent tax.\n\nI can highly recommend his book, Econobabble.\nWhy facts don’t change minds: Insights from cognitive science for the improved communication of conservation research. Really eye-opening paper about how people process information for decision making. The focus is on conservation information, but the underlying ideas apply universally IMO.\nAccording to Yanis Varoufakis, capitalism has been killed by technofeudalism – which is much worse. The thesis is that we are now serfs to big tech overlords (Amazon, Google, Apple, Meta), and that the traditional capitalist market is no more. I’ll definitely be adding his book on this to my reading list.\n\n\n\nChilly in Stockholm!\nDjurgården, an island in Stockholm that was previously the Swedish royal family’s private getaway.\nSemla – the Swedish equivalent of the fastelavnsbolle we covered last month.

    "text": "Huh?\nA resolution I made this year is to write a short summary of each month, for posterity, and for sharing with friends and family. You may be thinking, huh, why? Well, I have a few reasons:\n\nI’m pretty terrible at keeping in touch with people overseas, and given that I now live in Denmark, this could be a nice way of letting you know what’s going on; and\nI think it will be a nice exercise of self-reflection – something that I don’t do enough of.\nIt’s also a great opportunity for me to learn some quarto/css, which is what I’ll be using to create/format these posts.\n\nIf you’re curious as to how I made this blog for free, check out the quarto guide\nSo if you’re reading this, velkommen to the first instalment! I’ll try to keep these succinct and full of photos (you may even learn something about Danish culture). In addition, I’ll have a ‘photo-of-the-month’ section at the end (taken with my camera).\n\n\n2024 starts with a bang\nActually, it’s more like bangs for a whole week leading up to NYE. For some reason, Danes light a lot of fireworks. According to DR (the national broadcaster), 500 million DKK (111 million AUD) is spent annually on personal fireworks. That’s a lot for a country of 5.8 million, and doesn’t include the estimated 1.7 tonnes of illegally imported fireworks. Growing up as a kid in NZ, I remember getting a small pack to light for one night (Guy Fawkes). However, here, fireworks are legal to purchase from the 15th of December, but only to fire from the 28th of December – 1st of January. The reality is that people are lighting them weeks leading up to NYE (due to a lack of enforcement) – and they are way louder than what we had in NZ (it’s basically military-grade ordinance). Even with the excellent building insulation in Denmark (we have triple-glazing), you can still hear bozos lighting them at 11 PM on a weeknight…\n\n\n\n\n\nFireworks from our apartment’s roof. Note: you can click images to enlarge them!\n\n\nIt looks like public opinion is changing, with &gt;50% of surveyed Danes supporting a ban on personal firework usage (ref). In addition, the government is looking to restrict personal usage to between the 31st of December and 1st of January for 2024-2025. Though I’m not confident that this will be enforced. Perhaps I should have brought my 600 mm telescopic lens with me to Denmark to catch people in the act? If you’re interested in some anecdotes from the locals, check out this reddit thread.\n\n\nSnow in Copenhagen\nWe don’t get a lot of snow in Copenhagen, but some snow is more than I ever got living in Australia and NZ, and so I’m always excited when we get some! I’m keen put together a post analysing and visualizing historical snowfall trends in Copenhagen, so keep your eyes out.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSøndermarken\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDecent snowfall (for Copenhagen)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTaken by Matilda\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReturn of the Fastelavnsboller\nWhat the heck is a Fastelavnbolle (and how do you even pronounce it)? For this piece, I’m bringing in my historical and cultural correspondent (Dr Matilda Handsley-Davis) for some background on this tasty topic:\n\nFastelavn is a Danish festival with Christian roots. It’s part of the same tradition as Carnival or Mardi Gras – a chance to indulge in some excess just before the start of Lent. Unsurprisingly, fatty and sugary treats play a large role in this indulgence – hence, the Fastelavnsbolle (Fastelavn bun). A ‘gammeldags’ (‘olden days’) version is a sweet, yeasted bun filled with marzipan and/or whipped cream, topped with chocolate icing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGammeldags bolle - purchased from Københavns bageri\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGammeldags bolle - cross section\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, Danish bakeries nowadays (maybe especially in Copenhagen?) are engaged in an annual arms race to create the most popular, delicious, or outrageous combinations of pastries, fillings, and flavours. Croissant dough, berries, citrus curd, and mascarpone are some popular avant-garde ingredients. Some bakeries also dabble in the Swedish version, ‘semla’ – a soft, cardamom-spiced bun with roasted almonds and a lot of whipped cream. While the diversity is exciting, having now tasted about six or seven different varieties across this and last year, I would actually say that a good-quality gammeldags number is hard to beat.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAvant-garde bolle - purchased from Københavns bageri (our local)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAvant-garde bolle - flot snit!! (nice cross section)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe actual day of Fastelavn is seven weeks before Easter Sunday, so it always falls in February or early March – but the boller seem to hit the shelves as soon as everyone has recovered from New Year’s Eve. It’s surely not a coincidence that the season for this ultimate comfort food falls in a gloomy and dark time of year when everyone’s a bit sick of winter.\n\n\nInterestingly, Fastelavn also bears quite a few similarities to Halloween. Kids traditionally dress up in costumes and go from house to house singing and asking for Fastelavnsboller. If they don’t get them, they may ‘make trouble’ – so kind of the Danish version of trick-or-treating. Children may also gather to ‘hit the cat out of the barrel’ with sticks – now a kind of pinata filled with lollies and maybe a paper cat. Back in the day, the tradition was quite a bit darker – an actual cat, symbolising the Devil, would be put into an actual barrel and set upon by people bearing sticks. This was supposed to symbolise driving evil away.\n\n\nTo finish up, here is an approximate phonetic pronunciation guide for ‘Fastelavnsbolle’: fess-tuh-lowns-boh-luh (the ‘ow’ as in ‘how’ or ‘clown’)\n\nStory by Matilda – she may be making more contributions in the future.\n\n\nLooks like pizza is back on the menu boys!**\n I love pizza, but making a good pie at home is tough without a speciality pizza oven. A key element is the high heat required to cook said pizzas quickly – allowing for the base to be properly cooked, and for a nice spring in the crust. Years ago I previously tried a pizza stone but found it still wasn’t getting hot enough or cooking the pizzas quickly – ending my hopes of making good pies at home. Flash forward to 2023, when I came across a video by simpel dourdough demonstrating the use of a steel for making pizza. I decided to give it a shot, and the first attempt came out really nice!**That’s a Lord of the Rings reference if you didn’t catch it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe prodigal pie – first bake with new setup\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe steel setup. Top shelf of oven with grill turned on for max heat ouput\n\n\n\n\n\nI guess steel is far more conductive than stone, so the heat transfer to the pizza is much higher. The first two pizzas were cooked back-to-back, and took only 3.5 minutes each! I’m using a sourdough (66% hydration), cold fermenting in the fridge for 1-7 days. It’s actually a super convenient weeknight meal. I make the dough on the weekend, and on the night just need to fire up the oven, shape, top, and bake! If you want to learn more about the pros/cons of stones vs. steels, check out this article by seriouseats.\n\n\nPhoto of the month\n\n\n\nFrederiksberg Palace with snow. I love the contrast between the snow/sky (cold) and palace/Danish flag (warm). 35mm, ISO 100, f / 3.2, 1/1000 sec\n\n\n\n\nInteresting things I’ve read/watched\nOur world in datahas some brilliant visualizations of data on a range of topics. Here’s one on the environmental impacts of various foods, and why plant-based milks are better for the environment than dairy milk. IMO you should give plant-based drinks a try again – they’ve really improved (oat is my favourite).\nWhy Swiss trains are the best in the world: Really nice video showing how great the Swiss train network is. The received wisdom is that Swiss trains are the best in the world, but this videos actually runs you through why this is the case. If you like it, check out his other videos – he makes great content relating to civic planning/transportation. I particularly liked the quote attributed to a former mayor of Bogotá Colombia:\n\nAn advanced city is not one where even the poor use cars, but rather one where even the rich use public transport.\n\n\n\n\nFireworks from our apartment’s roof.
