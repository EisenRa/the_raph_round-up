<p>Nyon is a lakeside town about 15 minutes’ train ride from Geneva. With beautiful mountain views and access to the lovely Lake Geneva, I can certainly see the appeal of living here. My dad is originally from Geneva, and we had the pleasure of staying with some of his good friends. Great company, wine, food, and weather – an excellent way to end the summer holidays!</p>

<p>It’s a few months overdue, but better late than never!</p>
<section id="summer-netherlands-family-cycling" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="summer-netherlands-family-cycling">Summer + Netherlands + Family = Cycling</h3>
<p>July in Denmark is a time for summer holidays (sommerferie). Many Danes flock to other countries to absorb some much-needed sun and work on their tans. I personally feel that summer in Denmark is close to perfect – temperatures of low to mid-twenties – and I can’t comprehend why some travel to Spain in summer to melt in 30-40+ temps. This year, we spent a couple of weeks in Utrecht, the Netherlands, to meet up with some family visiting from New Zealand. Growing up, holidays in my family always involved hopping on what is perhaps one of the greatest inventions in human history – the bicycle. What better place to continue this tradition than the Netherlands, a country widely recognised as a nation of cyclists? Here are some photos from our time there (see the captions on each photo for details).</p>

<p>Given that I currently live in a country also renowned for its cycling – Denmark – you may be asking: “Raph, what country does cycling better, the Netherlands or Denmark?”. I’m going to hold you in suspense, because for the August Round-Up there’ll be an article about my first bike-packing adventure in Denmark! So were I writing this in July, this foreshadowing would not be possible :-)</p>

<p>Before heading back to Copenhagen, we decided to spend five days in Switzerland. We took the Nightjet (overnight train) from Amsterdam to Basel, followed by a beautiful train ride from Basel to Nyon in western Switzerland, close to Geneva. You can’t go to Switzerland without enjoying some hiking, so here are some photos from a day hike to La Dôle peak (1,677 metres) in the Juras. The weather was absolutely fantastic – 25+ in Nyon, but cooler in the higher altitudes of the Juras.</p>

<p>Nyon is a lakeside town about 15 minutes’ train ride from Geneva. With beautiful mountain views and access to the lovely Lake Geneva, I can certainly see the appeal of living here. My dad is originally from Geneva, and we had the pleasure of staying with some of his good friends. Great company, wine, food, and weather – an excellent way to end the summer holidays!</p>

<p>June feels like it flew by, and apart from celebrating our ‘Daneaversary’ (two years in Denmark) with some friends, there’s not a lot to report on. Therefore, I wanted to share a story with you of a field trip in Australia (2021) that I had the pleasure of joining in on. Enjoy! But first</p>

<p>Early June gave us our first warm summer’s day – a sunny, pleasant, 25-degree day where we made sure to get out and about for a bike ride on the local island of Amager. Construction continues in Carlsberg – though there are definitely fewer cranes around than when we arrived.</p>

<p>Ask someone living across the world what they think of when they hear ‘Australia’, and chances are they’ll say ‘kangaroo’. Australia is indeed home to an amazing biodiversity, with many animals found nowhere else on the planet. It’s no surprise then that Australia is known for its rich and ‘exotic’ animal life. Have you heard of a wallaby? If the answer is ‘yes’, you’d likely think that they are a small type of kangaroo – and you’d be right! The term ‘wallaby’ is an informal one used to refer to small or medium-sized members of the ‘Macropodidae’ – a family of Australian mammal that contains ‘Skippys’ of all sizes. From the strapping red kangaroo, clocking in at up to 85 kg (!), to the tiny mala (rufous hare-wallaby), weighing in at around 1 kg. Lesser known is the yellow-footed rock wallaby, the focus of this story.</p>

<p>It starts with an early morning; the sky is clear, and the day promises temperatures of low 20s – perfect for a long drive into the outback. A white 4WD ute (pickup truck) – with large trailer in tow – rolls down the driveway. The crew is here to pick me up: Chloe, Shannon, Lauren and Tags. ‘G’days’ are exchanged, my gear is loaded, and we’re on the road north. Our target: the spectacular Vulkathunha-Gammon Ranges National Park ~600 km north of Adelaide, home to the elusive and vulnerable yellow-footed rock wallaby (YFRW). Our mission: to check in on the local YFRW population, a part of Lauren’s PhD project.</p>

<p>As with many of Australia’s native mammals, the YFRW is listed as vulnerable. The YFRW was considered a common feature of the arid landscape a century ago. However, a mixture of historical hunting for its beautiful fur, overgrazing of its habitat by feral introduced herbivores (e.g.&nbsp;goats), pressure from invasive predators (foxes), and human land use change have seen the YFRW’s population drop. Thankfully, the <a href="https://www.environment.sa.gov.au/goodliving/posts/2022/09/yellow-footed-rock-wallaby">Bounceback program</a> led by the National Parks and Wildlife Service SA and other partners has seen a steady recovery of the YFRW and its habitat. Established in 1992, this program has seen a 10-fold increase in the numbers (~2,000) and areas occupied by YFRWs in South Australia.</p>

<p>Our drive sees us passing urban/suburban Adelaide, vast agricultural fields, and takes us past &lt;a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goyder%27s_Line%22">Goyder’s line</a>, north of which annual rainfall doesn’t support cropping. From here onwards, we’re met with stunning, rugged landscapes, and see some of the local wildlife that make a living up here.</p>

<p>After a long drive – the last hour and a half down rough gravel trails – we arrive at our accommodation for the week: a humble, thick-walled cottage, which I presume was built as a homestead for workers in the wool industry (yes, people farmed merino wool this far north!). It’s late afternoon: we’ve still got a few hours of daylight left, but it’s not time to relax just yet.</p>

<p>How does one catch a YFRW in this environment? Traps. The only problem: we need to lug them up to where they live. While we get to work, I get the feeling that we’re being watched. While hoisting the traps up these cliffs, we occasionally hear a few rocks tumbling in the distance – likely signs of the local YFRWs hopping about.</p>

<p>After a couple of hours of grunting and sweating, the traps are set, and we bait them with a mixture of apples and peanut butter oat balls (a trusty recipe). Sniffing, I get a strong whiff of anise. Shannon sprays some rocks around the traps with a scent that supposedly piques the YFRWs’ natural curiosity.</p>

<p>We’re up before dawn, as we need to release the YFRWs from their traps before it gets too hot. The morning is fresh, but there’s a promise of heat as the sun rises. After a quick brekky and tea, we’re back on the road towards the trapping site. While we climb to check in on the traps, we see the beautiful landscape brighten as the sun rises and hear the birds make their morning calls.</p>

<p>Caught wallabies are transferred to a thick cloth sack, and thrown over shoulders (they weigh ~6-12 kg) as we take them to our makeshift processing site – a foldout plastic table surrounded by some ancient fallen logs. Measurements are taken: weights, the lengths of body parts, and genetic and microbial samples (faeces and pouch swab)</p>

<p>Occasionally, we’d come across an amazing sight – pouch young (joeys) developing in their mothers’ pouches. Wallabies, like most native Australian mammals, are marsupials (from Latin/Greek marsupium, meaning pouch). The pouch is a key defining trait for marsupials, which are typically born very young (after only a few weeks), and start life with an epic journey from the birth canal to the safety of the mothers pouch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpsnREY-6no">see video</a>. Marsupials are our distant relatives, with estimates that we shared a common ancestor ~160 million years ago (when dinosaurs ruled the planet)</p>

<p>With a hard day’s work done, we went to check in on the other locals – this time, in a more familiar (and less vertically demanding) urban habitat. Arkaroola, a short 700 km north of Adelaide, is a wildlife sanctuary and cozy township. Established in 1968 by geologist Reg Sprigg, Arkaroola has become a base for intrepid travellers wishing to get a taste of the South Australian outback. This tiny town hosts a few motels and camp sites, a licenced restaurant and pub, and workshop/petrol station. With the sun setting, and enjoying a beer at the local watering hole, we bumped into Doug Sprigg – custodian, director of Arkaroola for the past 50 years, and son of the late Reg Sprigg. Doug is passionate about the local region, and a veritable font of knowledge. He’s also an avid astronomer – a great pastime up here, with Arkaroola recently becoming South Australia’s first <a href="https://darksky.org/news/arkaroola-wilderness-sanctuary-becomes-south-australias-first-international-dark-sky-sanctuary/">international dark sky sanctuary</a>. He happily gives us a tour of the local town – and distant galaxies, through an impressive telescope.</p>

<p>The week settles into a routine: early mornings checking on traps and taking wallaby measurements, the middle of the day exploring the beautiful landscapes and wildlife of the Flinders Ranges, before setting and baiting the traps before sunset. Warm evenings spent outside enjoying the company, wine, and endless stars.</p>

<p>Before I know it, our time in the Flinders comes to an end. After a few hours lugging the traps back down from the rocky landscape and cleaning them, they’re loaded back on the trailer, and we make the long journey home to Adelaide. The long trip back gives me plenty of time to contemplate the week and absorb what has been a truly amazing experience. It’s certainly opened my eyes to the sheer beauty of Australia’s rugged arid landscape, and an appreciation for the animals and plants that make it their home.</p>

<p>What does the future hold for this wallaby species? Human-induced climate change is likely to alter their habitat, making an already tough habitat tougher. However, knowing that there are passionate people out there looking after the landscape and animals, and organisations running successful programs like Bounceback fills me with hope. I believe that it’s our collective responsibility to ensure that these remarkable landscapes and animals are preserved, and that they can be enjoyed by future generations.</p>

<p>I hope you enjoyed this retrospective story. There are a few other Australian field trips that I’ll be sharing the future. Stay tuned also for an update on what Lauren found about the YFRWs in the region during her PhD.</p>

<p>Technically not taken in June 2024! But part of the trip from the retrospective story. The person in frame climbing gives a sense of scale. You can also see a dry river down below. Every year or two there’ll be a large rain storm that sees water invigorate this arid landscape.</p>

<p>I can’t believe we’re at the end of May already! The weather has been absolutely fantastic here in Copenhagen this month, and in this edition, we’re continuing with the spring theme.&nbsp;</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="svaner-på-søerne-swans-on-the-lakes"><strong>Svaner på søerne (swans on the lakes)</strong></h3>
<p>On my commute to the office, I’m lucky to cycle right alongside some lakes. Which lakes, you may ask? Well, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lakes,_Copenhagen">’The Lakes’</a> (søerne in Danish), of course. These lakes are just west of the inner city, and are a real iconic feature of Copenhagen. You’ll see many locals (and tourists) enjoying a walk or run around the ~6.4 km lakes.</p>
<p>Swans – the national Danish bird – also enjoy the lake, and in spring, some will nest just alongside the water. Last year, some kind people (from the council, I presume), actually built a little fence around a swan nesting site that was right next to the walking path. I’m not sure if this was to protect the swans from dogs/people, or vice-versa! This year, I’ve been keeping an eye on one such swan family on my commute, waiting for the day for the swanlings to hatch.</p>

<p>The day came late in May (the 22nd), so here I present to you some young (&lt;24 hour) swanlings (AKA cygnets – ed.)! It was definitely worth lugging my camera around with me each day in anticipation. All in all, another really nice expression of life coming back in the Danish spring.</p>

<p>Now for other expressions of spring – albeit less natural, as this was a visit to the Copenhagen Botanic Garden with my 105 mm macro lens. Butterflies and flowers are more similar than you might think at first glance, despite one being an insect and the other being a plant. Biologically, they both exist primarily for one purpose – sex and reproduction. Both are typically ephemeral (don’t hang around for long), and both bring an amazing diversity of colours and shapes to our world. They are also both quintessentially spring! While a botanic garden is an artificial environment, they are great places to appreciate Earth’s amazing biodiversity, and I’m always blown away at how much plant diversity there is in the world. Botanic gardens are also great places for taking close up (macro) photos (which I love). Them was the words, here be the photos, enjoy:</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="a-weekend-in-viborg-jutland">A weekend in Viborg (Jutland)</h3>
<p>There are many foreigners that live on Copenhagen who never set foot on the ‘mainland’ of Denmark – Jutland (Jylland in Danish). We decided to take advantage of a recent long weekend by taking our first trip to Jutland, specifically to a small town called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viborg,_Denmark">Viborg</a>. Why Viborg of all places? Well, there’s <a href="https://simpelsurdej.dk/">a great bakery</a> there that I found out about (they put out some nice video recipes that I have tried). It’s also where I got my pizza steel that I mentioned in the Jan round-up. Anyway, that’s as good an excuse as any to check out rural Denmark (it’s a city of ~40,000, so perhaps not so rural?). So off we went on a couple of trains:</p>

<p>Viborg is an old city by Danish standards (settlement started ~8th century according to Wikipedia). The old town is really cute, with many buildings at least a few hundred years old.</p>

<p>On the journey home, we spent the afternoon in Aarhus (Denmark’s second-largest city behind Copenhagen). A big attraction is the contemporary art gallery ARoS – a very distinctive building with its 360° viewing platform that has a rainbow of glass. Overall, a really nice relaxing trip, and it’s good to finally have made it to Jutland (though there’s definitely more to see!). Supposedly there are differences in accent between Jutland and Zealand (island that Copenhagen is on), but I honestly couldn’t tell! Perhaps it’s analogous to the difficulties other have in distinguishing Australian and New Zealand accents.</p>

<p>I’ve really come to appreciate the humble daisy. It’s not the fanciest nor most colourful flower, but it adds a really nice contrast to the green grass, and to me is a real signal of spring that I’ve come to appreciate since living in Denmark.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.seriouseats.com/ask-the-food-lab-can-i-start-pasta-in-cold-water">I’ve been cooking pasta wrong my entire life.</a>. TLDR: It’s more efficient (time and energy) to start your pasta cold. Pour cold water onto your pasta (only needs to cover by 2-4 cm) and turn on the heat, then cook to your liking.</p>
<p>James Shaw (former Green party leader in NZ) <a href="https://www.newshub.co.nz/home/politics/2024/05/livestream-outgoing-green-mp-james-shaw-gives-valedictory-speech.html">gave his leaving parliament speech this month.</a> If you don’t have the time to watch, it’s worth watching or reading the last part (my eyes definitely got a bit wet). Seems like a really decent person – something we definitely need more of in politics.</p>
<p>Keeping to the NZ theme, <a href="https://www.nzgeo.com/stories/the-march-of-the-pines/">here’s another great article</a> from NZ Geographic about invasive pines in NZ. It’s a big problem, and one that needs to be addressed sooner than later. Quite interesting point about how NZ’s stance on genetic modification is stalling the development of sterile pines for the timber industry – which would help a lot with preventing timber industry associated outbreaks.</p>
<p>And some more kiwi stuff… Hayley made a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVS-ulG7L4w">fantastic video</a> about the one of NZ’s Great Walks, the Lake Waikaremoana Track. Featuring a 60-year-old never hiker (her step-mum).</p>
<p>Not NZ, but continuing on the tree theme, here’s a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cndkF7bX3M">great piece of video journalism</a> from Vox about the forestry industry in Uruguay. At the start I was a bit sceptical – white guy from U.S.A goes to Uruguay seemingly to solve a mystery from satellite imagery, but it goes much deeper than that.</p>
<p>And lastly, if you’re into video games, <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.wawd.298754/gov.uscourts.wawd.298754.225.1.pdf">here’s a antitrust litigation motion</a> against the company Valve in relation to their video game distribution platform Steam. If you’re a gamer you’ve probably heard of Steam, but you’re probably not aware of the fact that they take a 30% cut on sales. This motion argues that the reason they can get away with this high rate is due to anticompetitive behaviour. It seems that they are intentionally stifling competition to maintain what is essentially a monopoly in the industry. This is usually always bad, as it means that both the consumer and the developer of the games are the ones that are paying for Valve’s immense profits. Gabe Newell (CEO of Valve) is quite happy with the situation, as he <a href="https://luxurylaunches.com/transport/gabe-newell-luxury-yachts.php">supposedly has an armada of super yachts worth ~1 billion USD…</a>.</p>
<p>Antitrust is something that I’m getting increasingly concerned about, so expect some future articles on the topic.</p>

<p>Spring has sprung! It’s a relief to finally see more colours in Copenhagen – I hope you enjoy this update :-)</p>
<section id="a-spring-to-your-step" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="a-spring-to-your-step">A Spring to your step</h3>
<p>Foråret er kommet (spring has come) to Copenhagen. Growing up in New Zealand and Australia, spring never seemed like a particularly special time of the year to me. Perhaps it’s the fact that most of the native trees are evergreen, and that we see flowering throughout much of the year (as well as winter not being so harsh). Since moving to Copenhagen, however, I’ve been blown away with how remarkable spring is here. Flowers of all shapes, shades, and sizes spring out from slumber – as do the Danes, who emerge from their hyggelige (cosy) apartments and flock to the local parks to soak in the rays. Not to mention it’s now light when you wake up in the morning AND when you get home from work in the evening! I guess there’s a few factors at play here – the winter being so much darker and colder here, coupled with the trees being bare and seemingly lifeless. Scent may also play another important role; just the other day I was walking through the local park and realised that I can smell plants now! Regardless, spring is something I’ve come to really relish since moving to Denmark.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="visit-carlsberg">Visit Carlsberg</h3>
<p>While Matilda’s parents were around in early April, we took a trip to ‘Visit Carlsberg’, an exhibition in Carlsberg’s original brewery. You’ve probably heard of Carlsberg. Founded in 1847, it has become an internationally known beer. Did you know that scientists at the Carlsberg Research Laboratory invented the pH scale? The founder, J.C. Jacobsen, believed that science was the key to unlocking consistent and high-quality beer. The Carlsberg Foundation (the not-for-profit organisation that controls the majority voting rights for Carlsberg A/S) continues to invest into science and society today.</p>
<p>In 2008, Carlsberg moved their beer production to Jutland (in Denmark), and in its place, the Carlsberg City District is being developed. (I’ll cover this in a future article, as it’s quite interesting, and a great example of how high-density living can be done well.) Overall, I’d say it’s well worth a visit if you’re in Copenhagen. I think they did a great job with the exhibition – it’s engaging, interesting, and well put together. That the exhibition runs through the old brewery gives it a great historical feel, and I think they nailed the design of modern meets historical.</p>
<p>While I always support local independent breweries, if I had to drink a ‘macro’ beer, it’d be Carlsberg. That it’s governed by a not-for-profit foundation that actually invests back into Denmark (and science in general) is clear. I’ll also admit that it tastes pretty damn good, and it’s clear to me that they continue to be driven by a desire to produce quality beer.</p>
<p>An honourable mention to Til’s highlight of the visit – the small fleet of Carlsberg horses and ponies, the former of which still draw the traditional Carlsberg beer wagon around the neighbourhood a few times a week. The rest of the time, they all seem to have a pretty relaxing life acting as Carlsberg brand ambassadors.</p>

<p>Someone made a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JheGL6uSF-4">graph of Wikipedia</a> – really nicely put together video with amazing visualisations, well worth a watch if you have 20 minutes!</p>
<p><a href="https://cosmosmagazine.com/nature/animals/turns-out-wombats-can-run-at-40km-h/">Can wombats really run at 40 km/hour?</a> An excellent article that touches on the question of ‘when is a scientific fact a scientific fact?’. It features quotes from David Taggart, a colleague and good friend from Adelaide who’s also the leading Southern Hairy-nosed Wombat expert – shout out to Tags! From my own personal experience catching wombats for many years for research, they can run bloody fast! I plan to write a blog post about wombats in the coming months, so stay tuned :-)</p>
<p>An area the size of 5 USAs is what humans use for agriculture today. <strong>77%</strong> of this area is used for meat/dairy production, and this not just for grazing (half of the world cropland is fed to animals for meat/dairy). Our World in Data provide us with <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/agricultural-productivity-crucial?utm_source=OWID+Newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=1761d4ee85-biweekly-digest-2024-03-15&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=0_2e166c1fc1-3875482ed3-%5BLIST_EMAIL_ID%5D">another engaging article</a> on this topic.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-03-04/australians-lose-one-billion-in-surcharges-least-cost-routing/103530946">Banks in Australia are making a killing with surcharges</a>, surprise surprise.</p>
<p>I also watched an Australian <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMUa-FlVWkg">senate hearing</a> about the issues with Australia’s supermarket duopoly. Lower competition = higher prices, who’d have thunk it? Greg and Matt from the Australian Institute do a great job highlighting these issues in plain English.</p>
<p>Finally, I highly recommend <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zCcJif8cuqo">this talk and discussion</a> from Yanis Varoufakis. A very compelling look at the consolidation in big tech, and what this will mean for our futures.</p>

<p>Hey everyone, bit more of a photo heavy round-up this month, hope you enjoy!</p>
<section id="breaking-news-sun-seen-in-copenhagen" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="breaking-news-sun-seen-in-copenhagen">Breaking news: sun seen in Copenhagen</h3>
<p>That’s right, sources report that the sun has been sighted in Copenhagen after weeks of seemingly vanishing. We took advantage of this uncommon phenomenon by exploring a bit more of Christianshavn in central Copenhagen. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christianshavn">Christianshavn</a> (or Christian’s harbour) is a cute neighbourhood with canals and houseboats, and was supposedly established in the 17th century as a fortification to the city. The most striking landmark is the Church of Our Saviour – distinct on the Copenhagen skyline with its spiralling tip. The spiral is not just for aesthetics, one can climb all the way to the top, where one is greeted with fantastic views of Copenhagen. It was a beautiful day for taking some shots of Copenhagen!</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="berlin">Berlin</h3>
<p>Matilda’s parents were in Europe, so we decided to meet up in Berlin. After a relaxing train ride from Copenhagen, we made it to the Big Pretzel. It was my first time in Berlin, and I’ve always been interesting it the city from a historical perspective. It blows my mind that the Berlin Wall – the barrier between West Berlin (Western) and East Berlin (communist) only came down in 1989! Evidence of these two separate cities is still evidence in the architecture, with the Soviet-style still being visible in former East-Berlin.</p>

<p>I also visited the Stasi museum – housed in headquarters of the Stasi (secret police), with many rooms untouched since the fall of East Germany. It covered the history of post WW2 Germany well and had many interesting historical items. The extent of the public’s involvement in the Stasi as ‘unofficial collaborators’ is staggering (&gt;500,000). Surveillance has definitely changed since the rise of the internet, with the U.S. government’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PRISM">surveillance of its own citizens</a> being something quite mind-blowing.</p>

<p>A highlight was visiting the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boros_Collection">Boros collection</a>, a contemporary art collection housed in a WW2 bunker. The bunker <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bunker_(Berlin)">(the Reichsbahnbunker)</a> is unusual in that it’s above ground (Berlin is apparently on swampy terrain). After the war, it was going to be too much effort to demolish, so the bunker was used for other purposes, including the storage of fruit. After the wall fell in 1989, it turned into an underground techno club for a few years before the police blocked it off. Finally, in the early 2000’s some rich people bought it to host their private art collection. Apparently, given that the building doesn’t meet modern safety standard, a loophole was found such that if the owners built a penthouse on top of the bunker, they could offer guided tours of the artwork in their ‘basement’. We had a fantastic and knowledgeable guide (an artist himself) who walked us through this amazing structure, giving background on the history of both the building and artworks (along with interpretations). Overall, a strong recommendation for the next time you head to Berlin.</p>
<p>Finally, it’s interesting to ponder some more on the use of the bunker. The Nazis apparently built the bunker also as a monument to the Third Reich – hoping it would last well into the future. By using it, are we acknowledging their intentions? Or by using the space for something else, are we protesting it?</p>

<p>For the Easter weekend, we hired a summer house (doesn’t come with summer weather, unfortunately), in Northwest Zealand (Sjælland), about an hour’s drive from Copenhagen. This was the second time that I’ve been in a car since moving to Denmark – which goes to show how easy life is with a bike in Copenhagen! Overall, a relaxing weekend, and I was glad to get away from everything and have time to read and catch up with family.</p>

<p>Check out this interesting <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fEwynSRBQq0">video</a> about the world’s northern-most brewery. Even if you’re not interested in beer, the history and landscape is fascinating. For those who like craft beer, I can thoroughly recommend their other videos (I also support them on Patreon).</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2oL4SFwkkw">Gas, the new coal?</a> Rollie Williams and team put out another fantastic video, this time on gas. I love Climate Town’s content – well-researched and engaging. If you’re looking for rigorous climate-related journalism, check their channel out.</p>
<p>[New Zealand Geographic] is my favourite long-form journalism output. <a href="https://www.nzgeo.com/stories/a-kind-of-magic/">Here’s a great article</a> about how environmental DNA (eDNA) is being used for biodiversity monitoring, habitat quality assessments, and invasive species detection in NZ. You can check out the <a href="https://www.wilderlab.co.nz/">WilderLab website</a> to even explore how healthy streams are near you!</p>
<p>Lastly, a very nice <a href="https://journals.asm.org/doi/10.1128/mbio.01994-23">article</a> about why society journals will be part of the solution for issues in the scientific publishing industry. I detest how the parasite that is the for-profit publishing industry is harming science. I’ll be writing a post about this soon to provide context for people not in academia, so stay tuned.</p>

<p>Welcome to another monthly round-up! You may have noticed that we have a new URL – I ended up buying a domain name and email server, so there’s now an option to sign up to a mailing list if you want updates when new round-ups are published (see bottom of page).</p>
<p>This month is more photo heavy than last, so I hope you enjoy some Swedish winter shots. There’s also an article about the hallowed Danish rye bread O.o</p>

<p>Matilda had the great idea of going for a winter holiday, and I’d also been very eager to explore more of Scandinavia while living in Copenhagen. So we packed our bags and escaped the grey clouds of Copenhagen and took a ~6-hour train to Sweden’s capital, Stockholm. Stockholm (circa 1 million people) definitely has a bigger city feel compared to Copenhagen (circa 600,000). IMO Copenhagen feels a bit cosier, and easier to get around with amazing cycling infrastructure. Still we had a really nice time walking around, thrift-shopping, and tasting baked Swedish delicacies. We also visited a cool photography museum (Fotografiska) that was quite inspiring!</p>

<p>The next leg of the journey took us circa 600 kilometres north, to a latitude of ~64°N! Adelaide by comparison is ~35°S (Wellington ~41°S) – so much closer to a pole than we’ve ever been before. We took a sleeper cabin in a night train (see photo), which was a really fun experience, before arriving at our destination at around 9 AM. Granö is a small rural town of roughy 200 inhabitants, and home to <a href="https://granobeckasin.com/en/about-grano-beckasin/">Granö Beckasin</a>, a cosy hotel and destination. Here we stayed in a hyggelig cabin, went for hikes in the snow, cross-country skied, and did mushing (dog sledding)! They also had a sauna and hole in the ice for winter bathing. We did plan to go for a northern lights tour, but alas it was cloudy on the night (good excuse to go back up north again!). Overall it was a really nice stay, and Granö Beckasin definitely seems to be accomplishing what they set out to do – making Granö a holiday destination and in doing so keeping the town alive.</p>

<p>A definite highlight for me was the mushing (dog sledding). We got to drive a two-person sled, with one person sitting and the other driving. The dogs take care of most of it (they follow the guide’s sled), but you have two brakes that you need to apply on downhills or when you want to stop. On the uphills, you also hop off and run to help push the sled up. The guides were super nice, and we learned a lot about what it takes to look after and manage mushing dogs. They know each of the ~40 dogs by name, experience, and personality. They have to account for which dogs get along with each other and their relative experience when picking the sled team. The lead (front) dogs also receive special training such that they can make turns on verbal command. It was a fantastic experience, and really made me appreciate how special these animals are.</p>

<p>After three beautiful days in the snow it was time to head home, so we took an hour’s bus ride to Umeå, where we had a few hours to kill before our train back to Stockholm. We took a nice walk along the waterfront (ice-front??), and came across a really cool sculpture made by Jaume Plensa. I only took one photo, but it’s designed to look similar from different angles, see <a href="https://jaumeplensa.com/works-and-projects/public-space/julia-2017">here</a> for examples. We then went to a really nice contemporary art museum, Bildmuseet, which as it turns out was designed by the acclaimed Danish <a href="https://henninglarsen.com/en/projects/0900-0999/0992-umeaa-kunstmuseum/">Henning Larsen Architects</a>.</p>

<p>The home leg of our journey took us on a six-hour train from Umeå to Stockholm, followed by another night train to Copenhagen, where we arrived around 8 AM. Overall, it’s one of the best holidays I’ve had – it was magical being so far north and seeing so much snow! Train travel is also so much more relaxing than flying, and night trains (if you have a bed) are a really comfortable and efficient way to travel.</p>

<section id="rugbrød-rye-bread" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="rugbrød-rye-bread">Rugbrød (rye bread)</h3>
<p>Let’s go back to Denmark, and cover a topic that’s particularly Danish, namely <strong>rugbrød</strong> (rye bread). Most Danes consume rugbrød every day – typically for lunch – and I reckon it’s the secret to their height and overall health :-) It’s high in fibre and extremely nutritious. Danes and rye (<em>Secale cereale</em>) go back at least 1,000 years, and my understanding is that it was more cold-tolerant than wheat, hence its popularity up here. A classic Danish food is <strong>smørrebrød</strong> (translates to butter bread), an open-faced rugbrød sandwich. This can be as simple as rugbrød with whatever toppings/leftovers you happen to have in the fridge, or a fancy version offered by one of the many smørrebrød establishments in the city (see photos).</p>
<p>In Feb I tried making rugbrød for the first time – mostly to practice for when I head back to Aus/NZ one day (it’s really hard to find there). My undertanding is that all rugbrød is made with sourdough due to the <a href="https://www.thefreshloaf.com/handbook/rye-flour">special characteristics of rye flour.</a> Rye has a much lower quantity of gluten than wheat, relying instead on pentosans (polymers of 5-carbon sugar) for texture. Rye also typically has a much higher (and more active) amylase content (enzyme that splits amylose into simple sugars). This is where the sourdough comes in, as the acidity lowers the amylase activity – preventing all the amylose from being chewed up, which would result in a gummy texture. I honestly found it much easier than my usual wheat sourdough loaf, though maybe I got lucky with the fermentation timing!</p>

<p>Sådan laver du rugbrød (this is how you make rye bread). Once again, I followed a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgLns9ujYlw">recipe</a> from the excellent <a href="https://simpelsurdej.dk/">Simpel Sourdough</a>. Seeds and cracked rye kernels are soaked overnight to soften, then the next morning this mixture is added to rye flour, sourdough starter, water, salt, and optionally malt syrup/molasses. Let the microbes do their magic (they were super active with this mixture!), then bake. Really nice as toast in the morning with butter and Vegemite/Cenovis or honey. It’s definitely a loaf I’ll now be making regularly, and a nice recipe to bring back to Aus/NZ one day.</p>

<p>The days are getting longer (finally!) Presently, the days are 4 hours and 22 minutes longer than at the winter solstice, which makes a huge difference! Sunrise is at roughly 6:40, and sunset is at roughly 18:00, so we’re over the worst of the darkness. We’ve even got some brave plants that are bringing some colour to the landscape (despite the fact that it’s 2 degrees C as I’m writing this!):</p>

<p>Thought I’d be cheeky and include a new ‘Beer of the month’ section! This month we have <strong>To Øl Natur’s</strong> <em>Omnipresent</em>. Really nice balance of sweetness from local honey, <em>funkiness</em> from the wild microbes, and fruitiness from local cherries. To Øl is a great Danish craft brewery located on Zealand (easternmost island of Denmark, where Copenhagen is also found). They have a project, <strong>To Øl Natur</strong>, which is all about barrel-aged mixed-fermentation saisons and wild ales. Wild here refers to not inoculating your brew with a specific strain of microbe (e.g.&nbsp;<em>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</em> AKA brewer’s yeast), but opening the door to other microbes. This usually results in super interesting flavours – but I’ll cover this in a future post :)</p>

<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>In Norway they tax the fossil fuel industry and they give university education to their kids for free.

<p>I can highly recommend his <a href="https://www.blackincbooks.com.au/news/read-extract-econobabble">book, Econobabble</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006320722004396">Why facts don’t change minds: Insights from cognitive science for the improved communication of conservation research</a>.

<p>According to Yanis Varoufakis, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fhgm5b8BR0k">capitalism has been killed by technofeudalism</a> – which is much worse. The thesis is that we are now serfs to big tech overlords (Amazon, Google, Apple, Meta), and that the traditional capitalist market is no more. I’ll definitely be adding his book on this to my reading list.</p>

<section id="huh" class="level3 page-columns page-full">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="huh">Huh?</h3>
<p>A resolution I made this year is to write a short summary of each month, for posterity, and for sharing with friends and family. You may be thinking, huh, why? Well, I have a few reasons:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>I’m pretty terrible at keeping in touch with people overseas, and given that I now live in Denmark, this could be a nice way of letting you know what’s going on; and</li>
<li>I think it will be a nice exercise of self-reflection – something that I don’t do enough of.</li>
<li>It’s also a great opportunity for me to learn some quarto/css, which is what I’ll be using to create/format these posts.</li>
</ol>
<div class="page-columns page-full"><p></p><div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container"><span class="margin-aside">If you’re curious as to how I made this blog for free, check out the <a href="https://quarto.org/docs/websites/website-blog.html">quarto guide</a></span></div></div>
<p>So if you’re reading this, velkommen to the first instalment! I’ll try to keep these succinct and full of photos (you may even learn something about Danish culture). In addition, I’ll have a ‘photo-of-the-month’ section at the end (taken with my camera).</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="starts-with-a-bang">2024 starts with a bang</h3>
<p>Actually, it’s more like bangs for a whole week leading up to NYE. For some reason, Danes light a lot of fireworks. According to DR (the national broadcaster), <strong>500 million DKK</strong> (111 million AUD) is spent annually on personal fireworks. That’s a lot for a country of 5.8 million, and doesn’t include the estimated 1.7 tonnes of illegally imported fireworks. Growing up as a kid in NZ, I remember getting a small pack to light for one night (Guy Fawkes). However, here, fireworks are legal to purchase from the 15<sup>th</sup> of December, but <em>only</em> to fire from the 28<sup>th</sup> of December – 1<sup>st</sup> of January. The reality is that people are lighting them weeks leading up to NYE (due to a lack of enforcement) – and they are way louder than what we had in NZ (it’s basically military-grade ordinance). Even with the excellent building insulation in Denmark (we have triple-glazing), you can still hear bozos lighting them at 11 PM on a weeknight…</p>

</div>
</div></div><p>It looks like public opinion is changing, with &gt;50% of surveyed Danes supporting a ban on personal firework usage (<a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1428869/attitudes-towards-ban-on-fireworks-in-denmark/">ref</a>). In addition, the government is looking to restrict personal usage to between the 31<sup>st</sup> of December and 1<sup>st</sup> of January for 2024-2025. Though I’m not confident that this will be enforced. Perhaps I should have brought my 600 mm telescopic lens with me to Denmark to catch people in the act?

<p>We don’t get a lot of snow in Copenhagen, but some snow is more than I ever got living in Australia and NZ, and so I’m always excited when we get some! I’m keen put together a post analysing and visualizing historical snowfall trends in Copenhagen, so keep your eyes out.</p>

<p>What the heck is a Fastelavnbolle (and how do you even pronounce it)? For this piece, I’m bringing in my historical and cultural correspondent (<strong>Dr Matilda Handsley-Davis</strong>) for some background on this tasty topic:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Fastelavn is a Danish festival with Christian roots. It’s part of the same tradition as Carnival or Mardi Gras – a chance to indulge in some excess just before the start of Lent. Unsurprisingly, fatty and sugary treats play a large role in this indulgence – hence, the Fastelavnsbolle (Fastelavn bun). A ‘gammeldags’ (‘olden days’) version is a sweet, yeasted bun filled with marzipan and/or whipped cream, topped with chocolate icing.</p>

<p>However, Danish bakeries nowadays (maybe especially in Copenhagen?) are engaged in an annual arms race to create the most popular, delicious, or outrageous combinations of pastries, fillings, and flavours. Croissant dough, berries, citrus curd, and mascarpone are some popular avant-garde ingredients. Some bakeries also dabble in the Swedish version, ‘semla’ – a soft, cardamom-spiced bun with roasted almonds and a lot of whipped cream. While the diversity is exciting, having now tasted about six or seven different varieties across this and last year, I would actually say that a good-quality gammeldags number is hard to beat.</p>

<p>The actual day of Fastelavn is seven weeks before Easter Sunday, so it always falls in February or early March – but the boller seem to hit the shelves as soon as everyone has recovered from New Year’s Eve. It’s surely not a coincidence that the season for this ultimate comfort food falls in a gloomy and dark time of year when everyone’s a bit sick of winter.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Interestingly, Fastelavn also bears quite a few similarities to Halloween. Kids traditionally dress up in costumes and go from house to house singing and asking for Fastelavnsboller. If they don’t get them, they may ‘make trouble’ – so kind of the Danish version of trick-or-treating. Children may also gather to ‘hit the cat out of the barrel’ with sticks – now a kind of pinata filled with lollies and maybe a paper cat. Back in the day, the tradition was quite a bit darker – an actual cat, symbolising the Devil, would be put into an actual barrel and set upon by people bearing sticks. This was supposed to symbolise driving evil away.</p>

<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>To finish up, here is an approximate phonetic pronunciation guide for ‘Fastelavnsbolle’: fess-tuh-lowns-boh-luh (the ‘ow’ as in ‘how’ or ‘clown’)</p>

<div class="page-columns page-full"><p> I love pizza, but making a good pie at home is tough without a speciality pizza oven. A key element is the high heat required to cook said pizzas quickly – allowing for the base to be properly cooked, and for a nice spring in the crust. Years ago I previously tried a pizza stone but found it still wasn’t getting hot enough or cooking the pizzas quickly – ending my hopes of making good pies at home. Flash forward to 2023, when I came across <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MH-EClQB8As">a video</a> by <a href="https://simpelsurdej.dk/">simpel dourdough</a> demonstrating the use of a steel for making pizza. I decided to give it a shot, and the first attempt came out really nice!</p><div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container"><span class="margin-aside">**That’s a Lord of the Rings reference if you didn’t catch it.</span></div></div>

<p>I guess steel is far more conductive than stone, so the heat transfer to the pizza is much higher. The first two pizzas were cooked back-to-back, and took only 3.5 minutes each! I’m using a sourdough (66% hydration), cold fermenting in the fridge for 1-7 days. It’s actually a super convenient weeknight meal. I make the dough on the weekend, and on the night just need to fire up the oven, shape, top, and bake!

<p><a href="https://ourworldindata.org/">Our world in data</a>has some brilliant visualizations of data on a range of topics. Here’s one on <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/food-choice-vs-eating-local">the environmental impacts of various foods</a>, and <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/environmental-impact-milks">why plant-based milks are better for the environment than dairy milk</a>. IMO you should give plant-based drinks a try again – they’ve really improved (oat is my favourite).</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muPcHs-E4qc">Why Swiss trains are the best in the world</a>: Really nice video showing how great the Swiss train network is. The received wisdom is that Swiss trains are the best in the world, but this videos actually runs you through why this is the case. If you like it, check out his other videos – he makes great content relating to civic planning/transportation. I particularly liked the quote attributed to a former mayor of Bogotá Colombia:</p>
